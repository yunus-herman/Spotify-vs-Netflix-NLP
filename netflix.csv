Hope someone here can help me out... I think everything is set up properly... I get Dolby Atmos out of my Roku which is wired through the Receiver and I also get it from the HBO Max app on my tv.

netflix,"Lupin has gathered a 97% RT Score and positive review for the most part but...

Looking at the IMDb review page isn’t very motivating. There are multiple reviews that saying that this show requires major suspension of disbelief and there are plot holes all over the place.   
So, should I watch it? For the reference, I enjoyed Sherlock (S1 &amp; S2) and the suspension of disbelief in it is acceptable. But the Now You See Me has some way to over the top plans that I am not okay with (it has the same director as that of the Lupin, if that means anything).",Should I watch Lupin?

netflix,"I bought a new Sony 55XBR900H in September and I very quickly started having issues with the netflix app. I kept on getting the same error: tvq-pb-101 (5.2.5). Some titles would work (e.g. Being John Malkovich) and some wouldn't (e.g. Real Steel)  


I tried resetting everything, I tried new accounts. Netflix support told me nothing useful. Sony support was helpful but couldn't fix my issue. Everyone insisted it was my network despite having no issues on any other kind of content, since they noticed that newer 4K titles weren't working but older HD titles were. So I bought a powerline adapter to test that theory.  


Of course, with my luck, now HD titles weren't working either.   


BUT! In my experimenting, I noticed that the titles that weren't playing were titles with 5.1 surround or Atmos sound encoding. I've been running my sound via USB to a Behringer UMC202HD and KRK Rokit 5G3 studio monitors; When I got rid of the audio interface, everything worked fine on the TV's built-in speakers. When I connected my speakers directly to the TV through a 3.5mm to RCA cable, everything still works.   


I'm not sure whether it's Netflix's fault, or the TV's fault, or the audio interface's fault; I'm just happy my TV is working again.

In the series Cobra Kai we are seeing groups of people starting to team-up and form alliances.

I think Julie will make an appearance probably by visiting Mr.Miyagis grave and bumping into Daniel. Maybe she comes at a time where Sam is in need of more a female role model that she can connect with.

As for Silver we potentially already know that he’s returning for Season 4 as Kreese quite possibly got off the phone to him. As for Barnes, well I haven't thought that one through. Maybe Silver and Kreese bail him out of jail and have him wrapped around their fingers.

netflix,"I thought I'd make a useful post about getting Netflix working in 4K (3840\*2160) and 1440p (2560\*1440) resolution. I decided to make this after countless posts and Netflix' own website being somewhat useless when it comes to key details, as well as a fix I found from another user. There are also countless posts saying 1440p is not a supported resolution, which is simply not true. 

For those of you on an NVIDIA GPU, (I'm unsure of the AMD process, or onboard graphics), you can also use DSR or simply modify to a 4K resolution for 4K content.

1440p: [https://imgur.com/rWVJNR2](https://imgur.com/rWVJNR2) 

You can use Ctrl+Shift+Alt+D to bring up the bitrate menu.

Here are the Netflix requirements, **but I've amended them so you can see what actually works:**

""Netflix is available in Ultra HD on Windows computers and tablets. To stream in Ultra HD, you will need:

* *A Windows 10 computer or tablet with the latest Windows updates installed.* **This is version 20H2.**
* *The Microsoft Edge browser or the Netflix app for Windows 10.* **The Netflix app for me is hit or miss, sometimes HDR = true and sometimes it doesn't work at all. For me, the consistent experience has always been with Microsoft Edge.**
* *A 60Hz 4K capable display (with* ***HDCP 2.2*** *connection if external display).*   
***NOTE:*** ***Every monitor*** *connected to your computer must meet these requirements to successfully stream in Ultra HD.* **Unfortunately, Netflix doesn't go far enough here. Not only do you need to be HDCP 2.2 compliant on EVERY display, it also needs to be over HDMI, at least on the first instance. You must be thinking, what? What I mean by this is, DisplayPort didn't work until I unplugged all devices and used HDMI. For some reason, then switching back to DP ONLY works. (Thanks to another Reddit user for highlighting this weird fix.) I sat for hours having met every requirement wondering why it wouldn't work, until I tried this.** ***NOTE 2: The same Reddit user confirmed his display was not HDCP 2.2 compliant with the manufacturer (LG), yet this fix still worked. Just use Windows key + p to switch to main display only if your second display is causing the issue. I disable my other one so you should try and see if it works for you, your mileage may vary...***
* *Intel's 7th generation Core CPU (i3, i5, or i7 models in the 7xxx or 7Yxx series) or newer,* ***or*** *a NVIDIA GPU that meets* [*these requirements*](https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/4583/~/4k-uhd-netflix-content-on-nvidia-gpus)*.* **I personally use a 4th-Gen Intel CPU.**
* [*A Netflix plan*](http://www.netflix.com/ChangePlan) *that supports streaming in Ultra HD.* **Naturally, you have to actually pay for UHD content to view UHD content. (and 1440p)**
* *A steady internet connection speed of 25 megabits per second or higher.* **This isn't strictly true, my connection is 19 megabits or less generally and I get the 3840\*2160 resolution with no bufferingt issues.**
* [*Streaming quality*](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/87) *set to* ***Auto*** *or* ***High****.*

Just one more from me, you should be using **Microsoft HEVC video extensions** if it still doesn't work: [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/hevc-video-extensions/9nmzlz57r3t7?activetab=pivot:overviewtab](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/hevc-video-extensions/9nmzlz57r3t7?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)

After some more digging, it looks like this display is ""not HDCP 2.2 Compliant"" does that really mean I cannot watch 4k Netflix on this screen at all? if there is a workaround id love to know.... seems silly as Netflix does not give me an error when trying to play content it just caps at 1080p, as well I've seen conflicting information on if there is compliance so yeah I'm frustrated just want to watch 4k stuff.

But I know that phase would only last so little before a more extremists lust for the show developed. Currently, now he has convinced several individuals to watch and become obsessed with the show. I barely have enough time to talk or interact with him as he is always watching the show and talking with people in private calls about it.

This post might seem a bit atrocious to some of you, but read it till the end.

A [Netflix for news](https://officiallyhaven.wordpress.com/2021/01/28/why-we-need-a-netflix-for-news/) basically means, things in the Netflix style, but it’s all about news- everything that’s happening around the world- everything that’s trending and everything that isn’t. Imagine having top-notch content made around the type of toothbrush your fave celeb uses, or the latest cringe shit tik tok users did- it would be amazing right? Or at the very least, it would make sense?

It's everything Netflix does- all the shows and the movies and stuff like that, but in this type of thing- they all center around news- everything going on in the world, the trends and stuff like that. It could be daily type of shows, the whole year could have a recap movie style, and people could have a wider platform to raise their voice and give flight to their opinions.

IDK, to me it makes a bit sense. Also, I’m not saying we need something like this right now. I’m just saying having a Netflix for news *wouldn’t necessarily be a bad idea.*

**What do all of you think? Would it be good? Would ya'll go watch it? if yes, what types of shows or episodes or dramas would you like a ‘news netflix’ to have? do talk shows count as news? if news netflix really becomes a thing, do you think it could possibly even overrun newspapers?**",IF... we had a Netflix for news?!!

netflix,"Netflix movies and shows are known for their nudity, sex and other R rated stuff in general. While I understand that a censored version could probably mess with the story or cinematics, I don't understand why Netflix chooses not to offer a censored version even for those who don't want to sit through unnecessary sex scenes. I also understand that it's probably not possible for them to censor content which they didn't create, but they could just have it for Netflix originals. If there's any specific reason why this option doesn't exits, please let me know. The reason I ask is because Netflix has come under a lot of fire in my country for having prolonged and unnecessary ""adult scenes"" (my country is extremely socially conservative) and the government is in talks to forcefully censor Netflix's content like they do with theatre releases.","Why is there no ""censored version"" option?"

My credit card was expiring so I just went on to update my payment information, and it said I'm now paying the 4 at a time price for DVD's.

netflix,"It's not that there aren't other shows or films that haven't directly appealed to me (Sense8, Anne With An E, Godless and One Day At A Time were all gems) but in terms of overall quality and creative control allowed, I find a lot of the material Netflix produces extremely... lacking? Out of the most recent dramas, Warrior Nun has probably come closest to keeping me entertained and it's not like I didn't have any problems with that either. I love slowburn, long-ranging and well planned arcs more than anything, and something about the ""let's see how many seasons this takes to run dry"" model doesn't really appeal to me.

I was just about to cancel, when I watched my first Chinese drama, The Untamed, and I fell in love. But there's another free legal streaming site (Rakuten Viki) which has better subtitles, so that wasn't a reason to stay. Then I decided to dip my toes into Korean dramas, and the ones that Netflix have produced are absolutely out of this world. In terms of cinematography, heart, humour, pacing... there are some that don't appeal to me as well, but a lot of them have a very consistent quality, they've become the only reason I've kept up my subscription to Netflix.

I've come to realise that I need subtitles to watch shows or films because my brain struggles to process sound, so that has not really been a problem for me. I get irritated when spoken English isn't subtitled, but other than that I have had no personal complaints—though this is different with everybody. One of my friends has taken one of the rather more drastic routes of learning Korean so that she can understand the shows better without subtitles because of her dyslexia. Not everybody will go THAT far, but there was just so much good content missed before in my life because it took reading a few lines of text to access it. 

Between Itaewon Class, Crash Landing On You, It's Okay To Not Be Okay, Hospital Playlist, Mystic Pop-Up Bar, Kingdom... not to mention the non-Netflix original gems, like My Mister, Prison Playbook, or Healer that are on Netflix, there are so many shows that—even if they might not even appeal directly to me sometimes—are undeniably good quality. I wish that more people over here could give them a try.",K-Dramas are the only reason I've kept my Netflix account

netflix,"Hi all,

I'm hoping someone can give me some insight to my problem because their Help department has done jack all. Their solution every time I call or ask for help on live chat is to reset my passwords and re-log all of my devices and has completely ignored the root of the issue.

To preface this let me at least mention that I build computers and have basic programming knowledge. I am no stranger to software and hardware troubleshooting and while I am no software engineer, I'm not an idiot either. 

A few years ago, I was getting locked out of my account due to (what I'm assuming was) several brute-force breaches of account from out of country IP addresses. The primary e-mail of the account was changed and the password, while still keeping my CC information. This prompted me to take more serious precautions to my account and the breaches stopped after I made a password that was 25+ characters in length. This is important because I meticulously started keeping track of my passwords and when they were changed so I could better secure *all* of my accounts. Netflix said they did not have access to my CC information, but I had serious doubts since they obviously don't have even basic protection of brute force attempts and no DDoS security.

I changed the password, wrote the password down, logged in with my desktop (saved login info within the browser) with this absurdly long string of characters, and then log the TVs in with same password. Everything would be fine. Eventually, my mom and dad would log out of the Netflix account on the TVs and I would go attempt to log into the account with the same absurdly long password. Its invalid. Perhaps I entered it in wrong? Double Check. No. Maybe I copied the password down wrong? I went back into my computer and recovered the password via my saved info within the browser. Still invalid. Maybe I neglected to save the updated password within my browser? So I went into my account info with my already logged in account on my browser, clicked 'change password' where it asks you to enter the current password and prompt you to enter a new one. 

Now, There's a way within the browser code to decrypt the censored password information to show you what the characters are. All you have to do is select the 'dots' of the password, right click, and select Inspect Element and the code will show you what the password is. Sometimes with different websites you have to change the parameters to 'type' to see it but Netflix shows you exactly what was saved previously. It was the same. Essentially, if the device is logged out for any reason Netflix is automatically telling me my password is invalid and I'm forced to recovery mode. 

Each time I call Netflix and tell them my problem, they just tell me to reset and re-log my devices. Today the live chat representative told me to make sure my browser security preferences is set to remember my password information and restarting browser, and trying to relog. It was already saved to that setting, and he basically said well you just have to reset your password again sorry. I begged him to make a bug report to their IT department and he said ""I will do that have a nice day"" and ended the chat. Not only is this bad customer service but only proves to me Netflix's programming is complete utter garbage. 

I hope somebody, *anybody*, can give me some insight or peace of mind because it would be easier than trying to get my elderly parents to understand technology.",Has anyone else had an issue with Netflix constantly rejecting passwords? I'm really frustrated here and Help support keeps telling me to just reset. I am now resetting my password every two months.

After watching the first five episodes of the six-part season, you could easily see the final conflict coming to an end but in a single episode? Looking at other Netflix 2021 and even some 2020 shows, it is painfully obvious that all of the content Netflix is releasing is slowly shortening by the year. Other shows such as Lupin have also had so much potential than to be a 5-part mini-series that it pains me.

Obviously, Covid-19 is a huge factor to why shows may be shortening as well, but if or when we are past this phase, I see it hard for Netflix or streaming services alike to go back to producing more episodes in a season purely because they are making more profit due to cutting their expenses while retaining their customer base.

netflix,"Really loved this series and it was a lot of fun to rewatch it and reconsider my first impressions. 

I initially left thinking Osho was this big mysterious figure, but seeing it again I think you learn everything about him you need to from the glimpses you get. The drugs, the expensive cars, living in luxury while his followers lived in huts and worked all day, he's years of silence only to be broken so he can call Sheela a bitch on TV. I get most cult leaders are frauds and not good people, but I really gotta wonder how he convinced so many people to follow him. How someone as shallow and crass as him actually managed to build himself up as an enlightened being. Obviously a lot of thanks for that go to Sheela's work, but she herself is clearly deeply brainwashed.

Speaking of the followers, I never picked up on it the first time (though I know I should have) but it was funny to notice how many of the interviewed followers found the cult during tough times in their life. Just funny, theyre explaining why finding the cult meant so much to them while just inadvertently showing the typical cult MO of seeking out susceptible people to brainwash. 

A lots also been said of the people of Antelope, how obviously adverse to change they were. However, watching again I definitely saw the same attitude in the cult members. Its funny, Im so used to seeing these types of cults really push the whole ""Be peaceful, be modest"" mindset. They were definitely unique in how they were very outward in their superiority complex. ""We're all smart caused we've figured life out, everyone else is dumb, fuck you"". I also dont buy the narrative that if they were left alone they wouldve just continued on peacefully. They were clearly up to shady shit from day one and were confrontational and aggressive by nature. Another cult? Maybe they wouldve lived peacefully, but this specific one was a ticking time bomb. 

What didnt change is I still think its weird how quickly the documentary skims over the attempted murder. We dont even find out the guy survived until much later on, and even then in a throwaway line. It seems, narratively, really keen to sweep that act under the rug and move on to Sheelas big exodus and ""finding herself"". I felt more sympathy for the woman who injected him, as she clearly shows a lot of remorse for what she did. Conversely, I became aware at just how adverse Sheela is throughout the whole documentary to admitting any fault. All her soundbites are on how she was a victim, how smart she was surrounded by idiots, and how she was working for the greater good; she never once acknowledges any of the bad things she did. The drugging, the poisoning, the attempted murder; not once does she comment on them, let alone expresses remorse.

In fact, I left the series thinking people who watched and found Sheela someone to idolise to be kinda disturbed. She's not a ""boss bitch"", she's someone who used her considerable power to hurt a lot of people and then laughed about it on TV. ""Oh she didnt do a good job!"".",Rewatching Wild Wild Country

Wow, I could not have been more disappointed by the overall quality of this show. Acting is terrible. Omar Sy is a great actor and I think he elevates the acting quality in the show, but even him has very poor moments, it's just cringy. Watched in French by the way, my first language, so I don't have any language bias on this one.

There are plot holes every 2 minutes. Story feels vastly accelerated. Characters' motivations are weak as hell, there is absolutely no reason for them to do what they do, the way they do it. This made the show unwatchable from the first minutes. The ending is weak and not believable a second.

My guess is Netflix tried hard to come up with a Sherlock 2.0 and faily greatly (story from a well known ""old"" series of books transposed in a contemporary setting, Paris vs London, with likeable characters/actors, comedy/drama). Even the music wants to sound like Sherlock but is only a pale copy.

netflix,I'm a long time sub of netflix but for the last few years I can't find anything I wanna watch. Back in the old days there was a five star rating system and reviews you could read and a lot of odd ball content. I've watched a few netflix original series only for them to get canned. Makes me get discouraged of even starting to bother to start a new one. On of my friends recently cancel because price hikes and hbo max just has great content.

Call My Agent is one of the truly well hidden gems in Netflix's library. Centered on an elite talent agency in Paris, the series takes an often humorous and sometimes sentimental look at the daily grinds of managing high-profile actors. And the actors are as prestigious as they come. Episodes guest star a veritable list of contemporary who's who in French cinema and television, including such international heavyweights as Jean Dujardin and Monica Bellucci. The stories tend to cast a humane light on the guest stars, focusing on their struggles to balance work with life, fame with privacy, ideals with reality, and so forth.

Tying all the episodes together are the stories surrounding the extraordinary people of Agence ASK. How would you feel about the future of your company if its leadership is composed of an unpredictable micromanager, an ambitious schemer, a hotheaded go-getter, and an idealistic bum? Toss in a few more interesting characters and some dramas here and there, and the result is predictably entertaining. I had so much fun watching the agents trying to resolve their clients' issues when they could barely manage their own. Like all the best series, Call My Agent makes you care about its characters.

I am very excited for season 4. Jean Reno will and Sigourney Weaver (What?!) will both make an appearance. As season 4 [will reportedly be the series' last](https://variety.com/2020/tv/global/call-my-agent-france-televisions-netflix-to-end-with-season-four-1203503040/), now is the perfect time to start binging.

The Night stalker was obviously a terrible human being who needed to be caught but how the detectives acquired his information seemed a bit off. During episode three, the San Francisco Homicide Detective, Frank Falzon, who was first to learn of the Night Stalker's last name and subsequently his identity discussed at length how he acquired that information - he physically beat someone he was questioning. Frank recalled driving out to a suspected acquaintance of the Night Stalker, approaching the man, and asking for his friend's last name. After the acquaintance refused to answer, Frank described detaining(?) the acquaintance in his vehicle. Once the acquaintance refused to answer for a second time, Frank discussed in the documentary about how he hit him to which the acquaintance mocked him. Frank went on about how after he was mocked he beat the man until he gave up the Night Stalker's last name.

Obviously this information was crucial to catching the Night Stalker but if how this information was acquired, was known, at the time, would it not be inadmissible? Something about a former Police Detective going on, publicly, about beating information out of someone who choose not to answer his questions just does not sit right. Though maybe it was just me since I could not find any articles related to Frank's physical assault on someone to acquire information.

Did it seem off to anyone else while Frank recalled beating a man in the back of his vehicle for information?

I know, the show has received some outrage regarding their presentation of crime photography and the events and here I am asking, did y'all feel uneasy while a Police Detective openly discussed beating an innocent man?

netflix,"I would really appreciate some insight into this, as I'm writing a novel that involves the making of a true crime documentary for Netflix (or really any streaming/ production company). I truly have no idea how it works -  specificially these points:

1. Who at Netflix comes up with the idea for a specific documentary? Is there a specific department for this? Are there different departments based on different topics? (My fictional documentary is true crime)
2. What would be the job title of the person who reaches out to potential interviewees, to see if they would participate in the documentary? 
3. Do they pay people to participate in the documentary as interviewees? If so, any rough idea of the compensation? 
4. Typically how long does it take to produce a two-hour documentary? How about a 5 part series documentary?
5. I assume the steps of making a documentary go something like this: Concept (storyboarding, outline, scripting) --&gt; Shooting --&gt; Editing/ Producing --&gt; Advertising &amp; Release. Is there anything I'm missing? 
6. Anything else I should know about this process or Netflix/ Netflix documentaries/ true crime documentaries in general!

10: Santa Clarita Diet; Santa Clarita diet is about Sheila and Joel living with their teenage daughter in Santa Clarita, Calif. Their world unexpectedly changes when Sheila goes through a dramatic transformation that sends her down a road of death and destruction -- but leaves her looking and feeling better than ever.

Dealing with the danger of getting their friend out of a gang and friends turning into romance, danger is constant.

8: American Vandal; American Vandal is a hilarious mockumentary about 2 friends (Peter and Sam) that film an investigation into, Who Drew The Dicks? Someone at the school, drew dick all over the whole parking lot's cars. The main suspect (Dylan) says it isn't him, but everyone else thinks otherwise. Did he draw the dicks? 

7: Daybreak; Daybreak is about Josh, a teenager who is just trying to survive in the zombie apocalypse. His main goal actually is to try and find Sam. The love of his life. He runs into obstacles and finds and unlikely group of friends in the zombie apocalypse. 

6: 13 Reasons Why; After a teenage girl's perplexing suicide, a classmate receives a series of tapes that unravel the mystery of her tragic choice. 13 tapes, for 13 reasons why, she killed herself. 

5: Cobra Kai; Cobra Kai takes place over 30 years after the events of the 1984 All Valley Karate Tournament in Karate Kid with the continuation of the inescapable conflict between Daniel LaRusso and Johnny Lawrence.

4: You; You is about Joe Goldberg, a bookstore manager, as he obsessively pursues a graduate-school student, Guinevere Beck. His obsession blossoms after encountering her just once. But theirs isn't a typical love story, and things begin to get dangerous.

3: Outerbanks; Outer Banks follows a group of teenagers in the Outer Banks of North Carolina who are called ""Pogues"", who live at The Cut, and are determined to find out what happened to the missing father of the group's ringleader, John B.

2: The Umbrella Academy; The Umbrella Academy  revolves around a dysfunctional family of adopted sibling superheroes who reunite to solve the mystery of their father's death and the threat of an impending apocalypse.

1: Stranger Things; This was expected, as much as someone might want to try and deny it, this show is easily the best Netflix original show. Do I even need to explain the plot, ill do it anyways. When a young boy vanishes, a small town uncovers a mystery involving secret experiments, terrifying supernatural forces and one strange little girl.

netflix,"Recently, in the past year of internet history, Netflix has upped it's game to not only battle the multimedia giants such as Disney, Hulu, Amazon Prime, and HBO, but the pandemic itself. In 2019 it seems that Netflix didn't release that many shows. They released 371 series and movies which is down from 2018. But in 2020 it seems as if they really upped their game. Not only does it seem as if they gained a lot more big shows and movies but the creation of new ones, and the purchasing of old ones. That's right I'm talking about Netflix originals. Shows that Netflix produces themselves meaning they don't have to license it from some corporation or studio like Disney. They own it. Recently they've added more and more originals, many were not at first but were later bought out by Netflix such as ""The Good Place"" and ""Lucifer"". It seems that everywhere I look on Netflix, I see the little red ""N"" in the top right corner. And not only are they abundant, but almost all of them are of an amazing quality. They're also producing them at an incredible rate. Take ""The Great Pretender"" for example. They released the show and it became a hit. 3-4 months later and it already has a completed second season. Do you know why that's strange? Most animated shows take half a year to an entire year to release a second season. They've cut this time immensely, this is almost unheard of. Netflix has upped it's game this year and stays in the lead when it comes to streaming services. Netflix reigns king.",Netflix Shits Out Shows Like Never Before!

netflix,"I’ve never been someone who’s bought in to spiritually, but the episode about Near Death Experiences was a total game changer. There was so much there to unpack. I’ve read about the brain’s ability to produce DMT and some of what these folks said (fractals, being contacted by beings, the tunnel, time distortion, etc...) seem to mirror things I’ve read about people taking ayahuasca or tripping on DMT. Even still, as you continue through the show, all this incredible evidence just compounds. After I ran through all the episodes, I rewatched the first one and saw it in a completely different light. 

In retrospect, consciousness is an incredible thing and we know so little about it when separated from the physical body. Just fascinating.",Just finished Surviving Death and it was terrifying and incredible

netflix,"Arisu mentioned that the game of hearts plays with peoples trust and friendship/love. He then said that due to them all being there, there must be the possibility of them all surviving. 

That is not really true, because of what we have seen before in that Tag game, where there were in fact 2 “chasers” having the different objective of killing everyone and not allowing them to reach the safety area.

He then “thinks as the game master” and says that the only possibility is that it could only be herself.

Why did he think so? Firstly I concluded that it couldn’t be the military since they had weapons and would just use them. Except of the idea with the fingerprints on the weapon I didn’t really find any other people to be 100% innocent.

So all in all: How did Arisu figure out that the only possibility who could have been the killer would be the woman herself?

netflix,"Hey guys ! 

As it happens, I am quite a huge fan of tv shows and movies that treat the fascinating subject of the end of times and how an everyday Joe would react to it. 

However, be it the latest seasons of the Walking dead, or the recent Black Summer on Netflix, it seems that these are plagued with one downside that I cannot bear anymore - Stupid decisions. 

I get it that panic and the end of times can lead people to make bad choices. I do enjoy these actually, when these decisions tend to be in line with the characters. However, these shows that I mentionned seems to be ridden of those, to the point that theere are quite unwatchable. 

Without spoiler, but for a general idea, these would for instance the following: 

\-  ""Hey I really need to go for a walk outside our heavily secured compound..:""

\- ""Why, it is dangerous !""

\- ""YEAH BUT I NEED SPACE OK""

Boum danger and bitten.

Or, the famous ""let's welcome these survivors despite the fact that they are sketchy af and let's lower our guards when we are with them (The school episode of Black Summer was really unwatchable because of it, despite one of the best first and second episode of the genra i saw!)

Thus, would you be aware of such show that would be closer to World War Z (the book) than to Season 8 of TWD ?

**The costume and sets** we very well done and super fancy- there was a bit of CGI to get the era backgrounds right- but it was okay.

anyway i hated how selfish his wife was he knew the risks himself maybe not all of them his creator and funder was at fault because he doesnt tell the family everything he is vague and only tells them in the momment which is on him and a big factor the failure of the whole project 

but ricks wife is to blame too becuase she wouldnt let go rick said that hes doing this for the family and have his kid live a good life a better life even. but she cant let go shes too damn selfish and decides to plot out a plan where she pumps saline into him at the end and get innocent soldiers killed who are simply following orders. 

i also hate how they killed the female titan that justifies nothing rick killed many innocent soldiers and was not at all punished. when the female was on the ground and killed that soldier they should have kept tranqing her or whatever knockout solution that was until she was down for good then send them to titan that way they can both repourduce. and i saw that the female titan was bonding with rick.

how i would of liked the ending personally maybe you agree

the immorale Ending: Rick bonds with the female titan and he takes on her path and kills all his bonds his wife and kid then they wait for the soldiers and get tranqed from there getting sent to titan and saving their race.

The Compromise ending: when all the soldiers are pointing their rifles at the family at the end with the scientist the mother should have just let go and take lucas letting the creator send rick to titan and create more of him to send up there yet improve from his other mistakes and create a evolution path to become a titan  that doesent lead to chaos. because i see it as theyre gonna need to make everyone a titan and if its done like this everytime than everyones screwed",i just watched The Titan and im disapointed with its ending

netflix,"I’m normally in the US &amp; have profiles Mandarin, French, and Spanish for listening practice. I’ve been in Sri Lanka since the pandemic, and had vaguely noticed that the options for programming with Mandarin dubs were different, and French/Spanish was much fewer, but didn’t think more about it until today. Just now watched a couple kids’ cartoons with Mandarin dub, then switched to French &amp; Spanish profiles to confirm that those languages weren’t available. Oddly, they ONLY showed English. Not even the Mandarin dub soundtrack I’d JUST watched for the exact same shows in a different profile. 

The interface language was English for all profiles (or blank actually, according to the profile drop-down). Within my “French” profile I then changed the language to French, which allowed French dubs to appear even though they’re still not showing the Mandarin option that I’d just seen.

I’m fine with the workaround, but it seems quite odd, was curious if anyone else had noticed something like this.",Strange behavior with different language soundtracks

netflix,"Hi all,  


basically loading the Netflix website, in any browser (chromium-based or firefox) causes my pc to completely freeze. Basically, when I load the website, as soon as I move the cursor around, it blocks, and from that moment, I CAN'T do a thing, except for pressing the power button and rebooting.  
It does not happen every time, but a week ago, and for the past 3 months it went quite fine. I had like 1/2 freeze per month. Now it happened yesterday to totally not being able to use the website (moved to the windows app). It works fine on my smartphone, I did not try on Linux yet, and sometimes also the app has this horrific behavior.   
It's still a mystery to me, HOW can a web app completely lock up a pc in this way. I tried disabling the hardware acceleration with no resolution at all, and no significant improvements.  
My specs are Ryzen 5 2600, 8GB RAM, Radeon R9 280, Gigabyte B450M-DS3H. I used to have this problem too, before changing CPU/Mobo/RAM/adding SSD. I thought it could be HDD's fault, as it happened to lock the entire pc when in high load. However, how can Netflix use more than 70% of my HDD? Now I'm on an SSD that works fine, so the problem might be the GPU that hasn't been changed, but still don't know how tf this can happen

netflix,,a review for Netflix’s Bridgerton
netflix,"Hi I’m a guy who hates pretty much all series and I feel like it’s a waste of time. Even though I hate them I’ve got stuck to some shows, for example The stand, The outsider and Manifest. I need something to watch right now since my country pretty much closed and fell into quarantine. I want a show that constantly is interesting and never gets boring. I don’t want to watch any animated show and I don’t want it to be romantic (there could be romance included but it should not be what the show is about). If you can find or know a show based on these criteria’s please mention it in the comments. Thank you!","Shows, I need one to watch"
netflix,"The super low bitrate for Full HD and 4k titles starts to get on my nerves. I have quality 80mbit internet and all other streaming services and apps deliver great quality, but with Netflix I experienced the following (streaming a few episodes a day, not constantly):

* I was able to watch a show on the Samsung TV app with great quality (flawless 4K and HDR). At a certain point (a few days/weeks in) the quality gets unbearable, independent of the content (Star Trek, documentaries, 4k shows, etc) and the time of day. Unplugging the TV and restarting the modem and the router doesn't help, the TV app never gets its initial quality back.
* I bought a FireStick with 4k -&gt; excellent quality with everything on Netflix, all the time. Thought I solved the ""issue"" (overflowing RAM of the TV or whatever). Maybe a week later, the content is as shitty as on the TV app.
* Got a Chromecast Ultra (Stadia deal) at the end of last year and tried Netflix -&gt; amazing video quality. Now -&gt; absolutely shitty image again (720p or lower).
* Today I was annoyed by the Chromecast quality and tried watching Star Trek on the TV app again. Suddenly it has perfect Full HD quality, no pixelation etc. 

So what does that mean? Does Netflix grant you nice quality with a new device and then constantly lowers the bitrate for this device? Do I have to rotate between the 4 devices (laptop included) now, so I keep getting good quality?

I really have no other explanation for these bitrate drops, and it looks like there's a pattern. Did anyone experience something similar?","Is Netflix lowering the bitrate drastically when you're using one device for several days? Changing devices seems to ""fix"" the issue for a while."

netflix,"I had high hopes for this series and was excited to start it. Unfortunately the only real thing it did was shine a light on how dysfunctional police forces are world wide. 

When they incapable of solving something, or just bad at their jobs and fully inept; they revert to so much subtext victim blaming it’s staggering. Within the first 10 minutes of the first episode they pointed out they felt the first few victims were “prostitutes” no less than 14 times and that the occurrences were in “slums “ full of “immigrants and minorities”. 

Why is that a problem you ask? What does that do? It desensitizes you to the crime, and is focused on dehumanizing the person and making them nothing more than their assumed profession. It basically says, “well if she was not a degenerate prostitute, she would be fine”. They even flat out say it was not uncommon for prostitutes to be killed and were essentially just hoping it wouldn’t happen again and did not do much work to solve the first few. 

Why people think Cops are good people is beyond me. It’s like joining the military. Minimal training, easy to qualify and higher than average income with things like unions in place to protect them from ever facing consequences to their incompetence.",Ripper (2020)

We're three episodes in, and we've audibly laughed in unison at some of Alma's lines. ""My tranquility needs to be refurbished"" and ""I asked for a pleasant room, and I believe they gave me one"" are two that spring to mind. We can't tell if Alma's supposed to just be freaking crazy, or if the actress/writing is terrible.

Or what about Beth calling herself an ugly fucker in the bathroom mirror? That characterization came out of nowhere. We've slowly come to realize that we enjoy the show the most when nobody is saying anything at all. Crocodile Dundee just showed up in the episode we're watching, and we had to pause because of how ridiculous it all was.

Are we nuts, or missing something?

netflix,"Okay so for the 1st and 2nd acts I was okay with the movie because I felt it was building towards something but alas the 3rd act came and I was utterly disappointed.   People have pointed out the film's shortcomings including falling in freezing water in the artic but my issue with the film is less about those issues (e.g. imaginary girl cannot/should not have a POV outside of the protagonist's POV) and more about its thematic issues.  

Namely the ending.  Okay so we find out the girl is the imagined version of his daughter he regretted not meeting that one day.  But why didn't he just go down to the car and meet her?  Why was he an aloof a-hole to the love of his life when she said she got a false positive pregnancy test?  Why won't he even look at her?  We're only given 3 scenes of young Augustine and none do a good job explaining who this man is underneath the surface.  The ending payoff doesn't work because it isn't earned.  We don't care about his relationship with his daughter now because it wasn't clear why he couldn't have a relationship with her back then.  The plot called for him to be emotionally distant in the flashback scenes so we could have a heartwarming father-daughter surprise at the end.  It didn't work for me.

Also, the ""false"" positive pregnancy?  Was his gf (wife?) lying to him or telling the truth? Either way it makes her actions look foolish.  If she was telling the truth then that means after she gives her ""break up"" monologue about him being a selfish explorer ruining his life that would mean she had sex with him at least one more time after that and got pregnant with Iris.  Or if she's lying about not being pregnant just so she can move on with her life with her child without this selfish man intruding on their lives, then why does she have a nonchalant conversation with him years later where he is aware of Iris' existence and she's not bothered with him still not wanting to meet their daughter?

netflix,"I have come across a very weird issue with my BX. 

My Internet is fast enough to stream 4K content. And the built in apps are capable of it (Prime and YouTube). However, Netflix is not. 

Netflix hovers around a bitrate of 0,5-2 and manages 480p at most. I have turned up the playback setting on my Netflix account to high, no change. 

Now the really odd thing: Netflix support directed me to fast.com, their own speed test. On my TV, it tops out at 3 Mbit at most, 80% of the time it doesn't manage more than 1. But when using speedtest.com I get around 30 Mbit which is lower than my other devices but fast enough to stream 4k. 

This discrepancy doesn't happen on my other devices though. On these, speed is consistent throughout. 

I have done the following:

1) Wired vs Wifi. Wired is what I'm running and it's marginally better than Wifi. 

2) Different routers. I have my ISP router and my own one. Same result with both. 

Has anyone experienced anything like this? It's really driving me insane because the quality sucks absolute ass but more importantly it is such a weird issue I don't know what to do.",LG TV - Netflix extremely slow compared to other apps

No other options. The bizarre part is that it's affecting shows that I KNOW have English subtitles on Netflix, as I've watched them with English subtitles previously. The option has simply become unavailable after my move to Austria. 

For example, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood - I've watched the first 2 and half seasons with English subs before my move (and it has English audio available), but when I try to continue it now, it only offers German and Japanese.

I have checked my language settings, and it's set to English. 

This doesn't affect everything, only a certain subset of shows, mostly anime.

Again, even shows that I have previously watched on Netflix with English subs/dubs have lost the option.

What haunts me about the movie is how this is portrayed as unchangeable, that Jake was just destined to have this sort of lacklustre, lonely, underwhelming life and there’s nothing he can do to fix that. So my question is, for those who have seen the movie, do you believe I can prevent my life from becoming like his, and how?

\-The Good Place (Made me question what being kind means and altruism is and the humor! It's a very funny show)

\-The End of the fucking World (I loved the british girl and boy's journey and how depressed they looked lol The teenager girl is my favorite)

\-After Life (I'm watching this rn, this man has suicidal thoughts but get support and I like how this show makes the subject feel lighter or even funny)

\-Special (I liked how salty the main character is, how sarcastic he is and the mother's love towards him, it was a turn off for me at the beginning ngl though)

\-Atypical (Very cheesy and I hated the mainstream depiction of autism at first cuz I know they don't look like the main character, but ended up enjoining it)

\-The Healing Power of Dude (I was bored so I started watching it, this kid's dog is always there for him when he's having a trouble at school and after awhile I started loving the show)

\-Everything Sucks (Well I only watched the first 5 episodes but I gotta get back to it, tbh got turned off by the childish tone and paranormal insinuation but idk do you guys think I should give it a second chance??)

\-Sex education (Watched the first 3 episodes I love it but after 1 episode I felt like there's nothing more to explore other than this main character got a role at the end of the first episode. Story wise, I thought it's not gonna progress any further and there's only jokes to enjoy, but idk should I give it a second chance too?)

Come on Netflix. This is so damn F-ing lazy, and becoming very common.

It’s not ok to just add a CC subtitle stream and think that’s enough. Meaning we have to have the subtitles on for the whole film. Or pause, turn CC subtitles on, rewind, play.  You catch my drift. 

The main stream would have these parts already enabled. If I choose English as the Audio Language then the subtitles should automatically come on for any non-English speaking parts.

It can output a Dolby Digital 5.1 signal, but this doesn’t send any audio to the centre or rear channels. The only way to get surround sound is to transmit the signal as **stereo** PCM from the TV to a receiver, and have the receiver upscale it so audio comes from the rear/centre channels. 

Other content however (e.g. *Money Heist*) claims to be 5.1 and this outputs a DD 5.1 signal directly to the centre/rear channel, with no upscaling required.

Can any audiophiles explain this? How can Netflix claim that *The Prestige* is 5.1, if you need to upscale it via stereo (as can be done with any stereo content).",‘5.1’ surround sound misleading...

I'm not saying they should add filler just to make seasons longer, there are a lot of really great shows that lasted a really long time and were great for their entire run, or at least for the vast majority of their runs.

netflix,"I'm sure I'm not alone as someone who enjoys the noise of a movie playing in the background, but it becomes absolutely pointless if the movie is in another language. I speak English and Korean, so when the movie happens to be Korean that's fine, but it's so unbelievably annoying to have all these foreign language films mixed into American Netflix without a way to filter them out. Oftentimes I'll read a description of a movie that sounds good, click on it and find out it's made in Malaysia or whatever, completely wasting my time. Or even Netflix's shuffle includes foreign language films, which literally defeats the purpose for me. I almost never sit down and watch a movie unless it's with friends or family, I just get so bored with passive entertainment. 

Netflix I don't give a shit that your library is dwindling. You aren't pulling the wool over anyone's eyes filling it with movies and television from other countries.

netflix,,Will Bridgerton on Netflix Have a Season 2? Here's Everything We Know
netflix,"I generally prefer TV shows to movies. I don't like horror.

Here are a list of TV shows I've watched and my quick rating of them. These are my opinions and others will have different preferences. But I outline them for multiple reasons. First, so you know which shows I've watched as to not recommend. Second, the ratings serve to show which shows I enjoy, so please recommend shows that are similar to the ones that I rated highly. Third, same as number two, but reverse uno- maybe you'll take away a recommendation if we have overlapping tastes.

No direct spoilers involved, but I do list cancelations when I know about them and sometimes I comment on what parts of the show were good/bad including endings, without revealing specifics.

#Action

- Breaking Bad **(9/10)**

Basically a classic.

- The Umbrella Academy **(8.5/10)**

Second season was better than the first, and the first was already good! I don't know if they can keep topping it but worth the watch for now.

- Stranger Things **(8/10)**

Great first season, but I see the show getting worse with each subsequent season. 

- The 100 **(7.5/10)**

New enemies become allies when there's a newer enemy. Rinse and repeat for 5 seasons. I stopped at season 6.

- The Witcher **(7.5/10)**

A bit overhyped by people who already wanted to watch it. Getting a sense of time and geography felt missing.

- The Walking Dead **(7/10)**

Great at the start and it tampers off with the plot getting repetitive.

- Jessica Jones **(7/10)**

I thoroughly enjoyed it but I can see how it's not for everyone. Season 2 doesn't always make sense.

- The Colony **(5/10)**

I enjoyed the time watching it but the plot didn't have a lot of room for growth and it got canceled. 

- Merlin **(3/10)**

Ending was bad. King Arthur was a brat undeserving of any kind of legacy. Wtf is this even?

#Dramas

- This Is Us **(10/10)**

If you like soapy dramas, watch this. You'll find a character you love. I wouldn't recommend to anyone who doesn't like that genera.

- Dirty John **(9/10)**

Loved it. Based on true stories. Good dose of empathy and reality IMO. 

- Broadchurch **(9/10)**

Murder mystery that relies more on plot and sleuthing than a draw to gore. Second season is good as well. 

- Afterlife **(9/10)**

Funny and sad take on grief and depression. 

- Living with Yourself **(8.5/10)**

Ever wondered what the best version of yourself looks like? What would you be if you did everything right? Good concept done well.

- Queen's Gambit **(8.5/10)**

I'm glad it's only 10 episodes, this is exactly the kind of thing that needed to be longer than a movie, but not stretched over multiple seasons. 

- Black Mirror **(8.5/10)**

Some episodes are better than others. 

- The End of The F***ing World **(8/10)**

Great show, strong second season tying into the first.

- Better Call Saul **(8/10)**

Don't expect Breaking Bad, but it's still great.

- You **(8/10)**

Pretty good.

- Jane the Virgin **(8/10)**

A catholic virgin gets accidentally artificially inseminated. It's a love triangle/square/octagon depending on the season. It makes fun of telanovella tropes. Great at the start, the last season seemed a bit lazy. Soapy.

- Insatiable **(7.5/10)**

The ending frames everything you've watched slightly differently without a plot twist. Good drama. It's about beauty pageants but they're the background to the drama. Soapy, kinda.

- Orange is the New Black **(7.5/10)**

Ups and downs with the plot. While it was intended to be political, the reality of prison life is actually also very depressing, and considering this is drawn out over multiple seasons, it's actually kind of taxing to watch even if I enjoyed it.

- Gilmore Girls **(7.5/10)**

My most rewatched show on Netflix. The more I watch it the less I like it, so I had to stop. I don't know that I'd recommend it unless you've started.

- Suits **(7/10)**

Better in early and midseasons than the end. 

- Russian Doll **(6.5/10)**

Groundhog day premise with an ending I didn't like. Good concept, not a huge fan.

- Wentworth **(6.5/10)**

Orange is the New Black but Australian. Less comedy. I'd cut the last season.

- Dead to Me **(6/10)**

Watch it if you have nothing else to watch. Kinda like Good Girls.

- Outlander **(6/10)**

Interesting concept but too much sadism for the type of romantic-drama it was.

- Sherlock **(6/10)**

I'm tired of the genius sociopath narrative, even though this was popular for it's time.

- Good Girls **(6/10)**

I liked the side characters more than the protagonist and the plot was a bit dry. But it's got some humour.

- Virgin River **(5/10)**

I enjoyed it more than my rating reflects, but I know it's not for everyone. The plot isn't strong. I think I'm unconsciously rating it higher because the wide open shots of nature made me feel nice while watching it.

- Blackmirror Bandersnatch **(5/10)**

Fun to tinker with for 20 minutes to an hour, but a lot of the endings don't make sense. Constantly operating the remote detracts from enjoyment fast.

- Sex Education **(5/10)**

Good premise but as a woman in her mid20s, I felt out of place watching teenagers give each other sex advice. Some humour. I can't really conceptualize who the target audience is intended to be.

- Glitch **(4/10)**

A great concept butchered. Plotholes galore. Mixing science and magic for a confusing plot. It was canceled to boot so we don't get to have answers. Don't start watching.

#Comedies/Sitcoms


- BoJack Horseman **(10/10)**

No show has ever prompted me to look at my relationships with other people as much. Animated sitcom, not anime. Most of the comedy comes from animal puns.

- Archer **(8/10)**

Sitcom. Relies on vulgarity, crassness and repetition for comedy but it's almost always fun.

- The Good Place **(7.5)**

I'm actually currently watching it. Seems like a feel good comedy for the most part.

- Santa Clarita Diet **(7.5/10)**

Off-beat comedy with zombies. Lots of gore but not in a scary way. Probably the best zombie comedy, but it got canceled, so without an ending and some answers to questions, I can't give it a higher rating even though I really want to.

- Friends **(5.5)**

A bit nostalgic since I was growing up with my parents watching it. I don't have anything specifically positive to say about it.

- How I Met Your Mother **(4/10)**

Couldn't even finish. About a guy who loves love more than the women he supposedly loves. Like Friends, I don't think this would be funny without a laugh track. 

------------------

Happy to chat about ratings as long as it's civil. I suspect the How I Met Your Mother rating will ruffle some feathers.

Based on what I've watched and what I enjoyed, what would you recommend?

I will likely not enjoy horror, reality TV, kids stuff or anime.

I'm iffy about crime or medical shows because they usually seem like long investments that don't pay off as well as other shows. Definitely open to fantasy or sci fi, but I won't start things like star trek that will take forever.",I've watched a LOT of Netflix and I'm not sure what to watch next.

I feel like they keep getting outdone by other streaming services like Hulu, Disney+, Amazon Prime, etc. Which yes there are good shows on there too but if Netflix were to keep the good shows they have and continue series that people actually like, then I feel like they would have a much bigger following. I think their biggest mistake at the moment has to be removing The Office, Back to the Future, The Notebook, and the list goes on. These are all very popular shows that people enjoy watching more than just once. Keeping these shows rather than removing them would be very beneficial for them. And I feel like shows like The Hollow that have a smaller following while all the people who have watched it enjoyed it, should be advertised in order to make more people see it and make more people subscribe to Netflix to watch it.

I've recently subscribed to Netflix, mostly for my parents' use. I've assigned each of them their own viewer profile, and noticed that there are sometimes popups that ask whether they'd like to upgrade to the next subscription tier. 

Is there any way to disable such popups for their individual viewer profiles? I understand that upselling is normal marketing, but there are three practical reasons: 1. they aren't always paying attention to what they are clicking; 2. they tend to get confused about unexpected interface elements; 3. I don't want them to see anything cost-related, so that they can just enjoy Netflix without getting constantly reminded that money is being spent on this. 

On a related note:

Is there a way to keep my own viewer profile but make it invisible on a certain devise (i.e. the TV that they use)?

I have had the entire series purchased through iTunes since 2012. But I preferred watching it on Netflix I had access to it on far many more devices. I also liked coming to Netflix to see what content is there. Maybe I’ll pause at a cooking show, or a documentary, or watch half a movie. It’s like instead of ordering what you want online, you’d go to the mall to buy one particular thing but end up browsing other shops and maybe even get something else unplanned.  

However, now that the office is going away, I can’t think of a reason to come to Netflix. There are no comedy shows to substitute and no new content worth hanging around for (for my taste).

It will not rewind 10 seconds this second time, it will instead open up the scrolling function where it shows you a thumbnail of the scene area you are rewinding to (the normal way you rewind or fast forward). It's very irritating because you can press b and get out of that normal menu to try to rewind 10 seconds back again with the quick click and it will not work, it will continue to open up the regular scroller and show the mini thumbnail no matter how many times you press b and wait a second. You have to wait close to 10 seconds for it to allow you to skip back quickly, which defeats the purpose. HOWEVER, if you DON'T press b but press A on the mini thumbnail, it will not rewind, instead it will not do anything and just resume playing that the same spot. If you were to click back once to skip 10 seconds (and it worked), you can click left again and it will open the mini thumbnail, if you keep pressing A on that mini thumbnail/timestamp that it's showing, it will continue you at the same spot, let's say you keep doing this; every time you do it the movie will continue playing, but it will still show the same thumbnail for 10 seconds. NO MATTER WHAT if you click back for a second time and click A on that mini thumbnail, no matter how many times you do it, no matter how much time has elapsed since you were at the part of that mini thumbnail, it will continue to resume at the same spot. THE ONLY WAY to rewind again is to rewind to the mini thumbnail that is one to the left of the one that makes you resume. This might take you back 20 more seconds, 30 more, 40 more etc. SOMETIMES clicking back once with the d pad will actually rewind you 15 seconds or more, it's just really buggy.

There is a very simple solution to this, change either the controls or the reset time for the quick rewind/forward. 

Either you can make it so that the quick rewind/forward resets after 2 seconds, so that if I click the left arrow again after 2 seconds from the last time it will do the quick rewind.

OR

You could make it so that the left, and right numbers rewind, and fast forward by 5 seconds each respectively. This seems like the most logical approach to me. Wouldn't have to change much just add this it would be quick and easy.
You could make it so that only the left joystick controls the time bar controls, and the D-pad controls the quick rewinds/forwards too.

It also would be nice if you fixed that way that it works when you click on the mini thumbnails. It doesn't make sense to me that if I click left a second time, it will show a thumbnail of the clip that occurred 10 seconds ago, but when you press A on it it just resumes. It's so weird because if it was going to resume, shouldn’t it be showing what I'm currently looking at on the screen within the mini thumbnail? I understand I guess if the first mini thumbnail that you are on when you click the left arrow for the second time is actually supposed to represent n = 0, and any thumbnails to the right or left of the zeroth one are ((+10sec)(n)), but if that's the case, the base thumbnail for 0n should show the same image you are currently looking at in the movie so that that's clear and you can tell where 0n is.",Xbox: Tapping left D-pad arrow does not rewind back 10 seconds like it should
netflix,"Like a lot of people recently, I've been using Netflix less and less. An idea I've seen getting tossed around a lot on the internet to explain this is that the splintering of streaming has led to Netflix losing a lot of its content to new sites. I think this is a reasonable explanation, but I don't think it's the full story. I think what we're really dealing with is that people have developed serious case of decision fatigue.

Netflix has always had to deal with the issue of choice overload, where the more options you're presented with, the more difficult it becomes to actually choose one. Take this phenomenon and stretch it out for the nine months of the pandemic and add the fact that very little new content is coming out due to said pandemic, people are just tired of having to make such a difficult choice over and over and over for so long.

With all these new streaming services coming around, I've watched people hop from service to service when new interesting shows come out on one or the other. What's interesting to me, is this feels very much like how we used to watch the tv. Aimless browsing until something cool comes on a specific channel, so you turn over to watch it. At this point, it feels like people are just longing to be able to turn on the tv and not worry about browsing through fifteen categories, reading reviews, checking which seasons are available on this service, etc etc etc

I think Netflix still has enough of a content library to be able to pull another game-changer. They should offer tv channels. They should just have constantly running streams for all the genres, they could even offer customized ones for your interests. No picking a show, just turn over to the streaming section and watch whatever's on. Don't like it? Change the channel. It feels weird to say that going back to the old style is a game-changer, but I really think it is. I would honestly love this. I think people really miss being able to mindlessly turn on the tv and just watch something.","Netflix's problem isn't content, it's decision fatigue."

netflix,"**The problem**

Since Netflix intruduced the new shot-based encoding, its streaming quality has drastically decreased on my machine.

There often are artifacts and I generally see a lack of details in the video. The image looks like a badly compressed JPEG.

It became very apparent during the final credits of The Queen's Gamit.  Here are some photos that I took (sorry for the bad quality, I couldn't take screenshots due to the DRM): [https://imgur.com/a/iVcrI9t](https://imgur.com/a/iVcrI9t)

**My setup**

I watch in 1440p on Windows 10, using my WQHD monitor and either Microsoft Edge or the Netflix Windows App (they both stream in the same bitrate and thus quality).

**Technical details**

When I press *Ctrl + Shift + Alt + D,* it shows me:

* Playing bitrate (a/v): 128 / 846 (2560x1440)
* Codec: \[...\] hevc

My internet connection is very stable and reaches 300mbit/s.

Using the exact same setup some months ago, the quality on Netflix was fantastic. Now it's awful.

Just for comparison: if I stream in Chrome, the resolution is capped at 720p due to DRM . Then, I still get a bitrate of 600-700 (kbit/s I guess?). So it really doesn't surprise me that the quality in 1440p with a bitrate of 846 kbit/s is garbage.

**Other people facing the same problem**

It seems that I am not alone with this problem. Here are some sources complaining about this change:

* [https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/j40k7f/does\_the\_netflix\_app\_on\_windows\_10\_support/g7wuc2i?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/j40k7f/does_the_netflix_app_on_windows_10_support/g7wuc2i?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

* [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24310104](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24310104)

&amp;#x200B;

**Solution?**

I searched the internet for quite a while but I couldn't find any solution. It seems that I am already using the ideal codec (HEVC). I also talked to Netflix via the chat but they weren't helpful at all. All their questions implied that the problem is on my side (what monitor are you using, have you installed all the updates, did you try using another browser, did you try connecting via an ethernet cable, etc.).

To me it seems there is only one solution: Netflix has to bump up the bitrate again. It's really a pity they are investing a lot of money in beautifully-shot series and then they screw it all up in the last step by streaming in a very low bitrate.

netflix,"Netflix's soapy drama Virgin River officially returns for Season 3 on the streaming platform.

Viewers can breathe a sigh of relief knowing that the burning questions posed in Season 2's finale are going (hopefully) to be answered. Returning for 10 additional episodes, expect to learn the fate of Jack (Martin Henderson), who was shot in the final moments of the last installment released.

Perhaps there's some reassurance in the fact that Henderson returns for Season 3 alongside Alexandria Breckenridge, Tim Matheson, Annette O'Toole, Colin Lawrence, Benjamin Hollingsworth, Grayson Gurnsey, Lauren Hammersley, Sarah Dugdale, Jenny Cooper, Daniel Gillies, Chase Petriw, Marco Grazzini, and more fan favorites.

Season 3 also makes way for two new characters as Zibby Allen (The Flash, Grey's Anatomy) and Stacey Farber (Saving Hope, Diggstown) join the fray. Allen recurs as Jack's sister, Brie who is a smart and ""ballsy"" lawyer. Farber portrays Lilly's (Lynda Boyd) daughter, Tara Anderson.

As fans recall, Season 2 of the drama saw Melinda Monroe (Breckenridge) return to the titular northern Californian town where she reconnects with Jack and continues to plant roots.

For now, there is no official premiere date for Season 3.

Sometimes I want to do other things at the same time as I watch tv so I want to hear it when I'm not looking at it.

netflix,"I am reposting this with some updates based on comments and Netflix support. Just for context, I posted about this issue around a month ago, responded with information that I didn't include in my previous post, and ended up contacting Netflix support. So I am reposting with updated information, in the hopes that someone will be able to help solve my issue. Post begins:

Some basic points:

* I am using the Windows 10 app, but I have also tested in Edge with no luck
* I have a native 4k display (LG CX)
* The resolution is set to 4k60Hz
* I have a supported CPU and GPU (i7-7700k, 1070 Ti)
* The GPU, monitor, and cable all support HDMI 2.0 
* ...Meaning not a bandwidth issue (I have also tested in other content)
* I have paid for and installed HEVC video extensions
* I have enough internet speed for it (300Mbps DL)
* GPU and display support HDCP
* I have the correct Netflix plan

And with all of that, I am still only getting HDR content on Netflix, NOT 4k. There is no ""Ultra HD"" tag on any content on Netflix, and the max I can get is 1080pHDR. I have confirmed this by using the debug stats, no matter how long I wait, it never transforms to 4kHDR.

And also, like I said above, I have enough bandwidth for it, the monitor supports HDMI 2.1, the GPU supports HDMI 2.0, and the cable is HDMI 2.0 certified. HDMI 2.0 has enough bandwidth for 4k, 60Hz, HDR, at 4:2:2 12 bit. I haven't had any other issues with any other content either. So not a bandwidth issue.

And yes, I have installed HEVC video extensions. Though I really shouldn't have to state this at all considering i'm playing HDR, but I know it will come up in the comments somewhere, which is why I would like to reiterate.

So, any ideas? At this point I meet all of the criteria, it's just... not working.

I have also contacted Netflix support and they agreed that I should be able watch 4k and ended up escalating the issue. So far I have not received a follow-up email despite the fact that I requested one, and my issue is still present, so I am going to safely assume that my escalated support request will have no results.

Also, since no doubt it will come up, I can't use the TV app for other reasons. I need surround sound through USB and my TV (the LG CX) doesn't do that, so I am stuck with the Windows 10 app.",I can't watch Netflix in 4k on Windows 10

netflix,"I have had a netflix account since the days of prominent DVD rentals. I don't even know if streaming was an option back then haha.

I have a higher tier profile that allows multiple screens to view and currently have approximately 5 people in 3 homes that access my account. I have culled that way down from what it was in the past because of some bad actors making changes to my profile. However, this has not stopped which means it is someone who still has access to the account.

I have tried calling Netflix to see if I can identify who made the changes and to see if there are any USEFUL security measures that they can implement to help. The answer to both is no. I was given a PHYSICAL address to send a LETTER by USPS for submitting a complaint to their corporate office but this is obviously not an acceptable method since it's not 1964...

So here is my question, does anyone know of any 3rd party security software that might work to restrict access to changing account settings? Please do not tell me that I can simply change my password or that I can add locks onto profiles. The locks are entirely useless because they only lock viewing, not account changes.

Someone convince me to keep paying a monthly fee to a company that seems hell bent on the worst possible user experience for their service?  I haven't watched a single episode of The Mandalorian, but I'm about to start!

What _does_ work, sorta: A Dex cable (usb-c to HDMI) from phone to TV. This will produce a picture, *but* it's locked to 480p. It's ok for animated shows like Big Mouth, but for movies it's a trash picture. Dark image, hugely pixelated, largely unwatchable.

So before I cancel the subscription and raise the Jolly Roger up the mast, any ideas for a work around?  Any way to trick the Netflix app on my phone into displaying a higher quality output?  Any _reliable_ way to remove the idiotic HDCP from the signal?

netflix,"This is about the Netflix TV app, I don't know about PC or smartphone. I also know this is not an official netflix sub but I'm not sure where else I can post feedback that will receive actual attention.

1. I'm tired of adding movies to ""My list"" to watch in the future since half of the time they just disappear on me. For the love of god add an ""expiration date"" in the info or something.
2. You're going for quantity over quality. There's so much content that it's hard to choose what to watch anyway - it's a known ""issue"" that sometimes you end up scrolling and leaving, essentially not watching anything at all. Instead of making like 10 original productions a month or something make 2, but make them good. Your service is like a sprinkler, going all over the place. Eventually one of your competitors will give you a hard time if you won't change your attitude. One show that is liked by most people is much better than 50 shows that are liked only by some.
3. Excuse me but your recommendation system is a joke. I strictly leave a like on movies and shows that I actually REALLY like, but the content you push in my profile 90% of the time is not the content I'm interested in at all. I have to look for it myself, which can take a while, but when I do find something that I am really interested in, I'm thinking ""why the f\*\*k did I have to look for it this hard?"". I'm not going to compare you to Google because obviously they have a huge advantage when it comes to ""predicting what you want"", but still, when I open YouTube, I find something that interests me without looking for it, usually immediately. Try to be like that, don't just give me random stuff.

And that's basically it. I got used to issue #2 and #3 tbf, but issue #1 is the real reason for this post.","Dear Netflix, here are some problems with your service that I'm sure many can relate to."

netflix,"As the title suggests I just hate the Series;

The judges are sometimes just boring.

Hunter is a very unpleasant host and has to constantly tell the judges what to do or narrate the entire episode.

I hate the way they work with the time feature; what I mean by that is, that all of them start with the same time but as soon as one finishes their first round everybody starts losing time because if you buzz your clock doesn't stop. Your clock keeps ticking even if you finished your first round. If for example every team would buzz at the same time the clock for your second round would keep going and you lose valuable time just because the judges have to get to every team to taste and explain etc. 

But what is really infuriating to me is that even if you get kicked out by the next round you'd still need to start with the second round. This even happens with the final round which is just insane to me since you may have already cakes in the oven or a finished buttercream and then you just leave the station while you already wasted resources and food for no reason whatsoever. 

This series just makes me angry since if you just wait between each round you wouldn't waste unnecessary resources etc.

Whose ""voice actors"" do you all prefer in this one? Original actors or the VO into English?

netflix," [SPOILERS] I was thinking since the very start of the 3rd game there would be a way to transfer ownership to 2-3 people at once via reflection/mirror and or cutting ones eye out the socket to be able to look at multiple people at once if they really do specifically look into each other’s eyes. I felt like the game of the second episode is by far the hardest. Also, found episode 1 stupid cause it seemed like you just didn’t have to enter the room to get lasered so couldn’t the lady literally have done the same exact method of putting an id on the other side to see if it was the right way to go or not. The exaggerated entering rooms seeing if you’d die was annoying also, the difficulty of that #5 puzzle is wayyyyyy harder then the other #3 and #7 puzzle so far in my opinion because the others have possible exploits while I can’t think of one for the #5 puzzle if the lady had done her job correctly and shot them as soon as they both walked through the door instead of creeping up like a dumbass that would be more believable and also made her win. Also, wanted to point out if the 2 taggers were also in the bombed building wouldn’t they have died as well making challenge 5 only passable by the others therefore just making the tagger dumbasses or murderers? Also, if the mind puzzle was only a level 3 for the way it was solved it’s for sure the hardest category unless you’re some gamer gunk 300 iq person and pays attention to surroundings a lot but who would do that without having preconceived notions of something?",Alice in borderlands episode 1-3 solution/discussion.

I love the diverse cultures and countries involved in Netflix productions. I can watch a Spanish series without trying to find a subtitle, I can find many German shows to improve my listening skills, etc. However, I was wondering how popular are these non-English shows worldwide? Some shows like *La Casa de Papel* and *Dark* are very well-known but I am talking in general. Is there a source where I can find statistics on how much non-English shows are watched and liked in countries that do not speak the language? I discovered *Las Chicas del Cable* three years after its production, for instance. Almost everyone around me watched *Dark* but no one has watched *Wir sind die Welle*.

.

#Minor spoiler alert :
The show has too much ""problem"" and conflicts, for my standard. But i imagine the general population will love it.

.

1st problem : the ""incompetence"" of the Commander, it is clearly a misunderstanding, anyone can make that mistake. A dying family member also won't affect the real professional that much. There is no way the real mars mission will have such a fuss over that problem.

.

2nd problem : Solar panel malfunction.  Even if 1 out of 3 solar panel malfunctioned, there is no reason for the entire crew to die as feared in the series. They can always redirect the power only for the essentials, even spacecraft from 1970 already have this function. The life and death situation of the spacewalk can easily be solved if only they have a SLIGHTLY longer tether -_- which is of course will be available in the real mars mission

.

3rd problem : water recycle malfunction, why does it fail so easily, they must've prepared them for decades with rigorous testing, i highly doubt such an important function will fail like that 

Aaand of course there will be cheeky romance in the spacecraft, which is... Not necessary(?) But yeah it increase the drama so i'll give it a pass","AWAY, humanity's first journey to Mars, surpasses my expectation. However..."

And then she fucks a woman because they talked for an hour or two. And then she gets fucked up more and dances in her undies more.

The actress might not look exactly like Selena but they depicted her teenage hood well and got her style right. And i feel the ending was good too. It set up Selena’s Hit Como La Flor and i genuinely got chills when AB finally figured out the tune in his head and when Pete and Selena were writing Como La Flor.

netflix,,Well...
netflix,"I have been using Safari to watch Netflix on my iPad Air 4 as the quality seems to be generally a lot better than in the app. Last night for the first time, I noticed that certain videos have started to flicker in bright scenes. It's very noticeable when the screen is mostly filled with a bright sky, and what I would describe as faint shadows appear and disappear every second. It also seems to only happen in full screen.
​
The two videos I have noticed this on so far are Angel Has Fallen and The Crown. I don't know if it's caused by the fact that they are 4K or in Dolby Vision, but it's driving me crazy. Has anyone else experienced this?",Netflix Flicker on iPad Safari

2. How did she forget she was holding hands with Edgar in the elevator before the Christmas party when she is being asked if she has ever been kissed or held hands literally 10 minutes later?

netflix,"Hi all,

I personally don't have Netflix. But, have been tasked with trying to help the owner's mom with a problem they're having watching Netflix.

They've got a 2015 Mac Mini  hooked up to an  Acer al2016wb. This monitor only has VGA and HD-15 Dsub connctors. No HDMI whatsoever.

She said that things had been working. But, now when she tries to view Neflix, she gets the Netflix Error S7363-1260-48444350. A search for that error suggests the monitor is non-compliant, and someone else she talked with suggested it was her modem (how can a modem effect DHCP?!?!?)

She said they were also having a problem watching Netflix on their TV. But, she normally didn't do anything that that, so is going to have her husband call me back so we can talk further. I'm not 100% sure the TV is physically connected to the Mac Mini, or not. If not, that's obviously a different issue.

But, my primary reason for a msg here was to see if Netflix flipped some switch recently that caused her Netflix to stop running, when it had been working fine prior?",Did Netflix recently start enforcing HDCP compliance??

Reading about it on Wikipedia, it's impressive how much cultural significance the movie holds too, openly discussing problems of colonialism as well as problems that come with independence and conflicts between different groups in Nigeria.

P. S. If not on Netlix, some other streaming platform will do,  I can't find it anywhere at this very moment. It would mean very much to me because Call my agent has been very funny series and it was something that differs from standard american teen drama. Thanks once again

netflix,"Hello Guys,

This is Marwa ElDiwiny, the host of IEEE Soft Robotics Podcast. I host Latif Nasser lately on my show and other figures from scientific and political community to discuss how science shape our society. My dream is to make a TV show series about soft robotics, my show is only audio podcast, however, we managed to have audience from 60 demographic regions... I dont know if anyone here know a scientific producer or production company would be interested TV show series about soft robotics :)",Looking Scientific Producer?
netflix,"Ok I was kinda looking forward to this show... I finally got round to watching it this evening.... And pretty much right away i started to get the prangs of doubt in the back of my head.

I first felt this as the introduction is painfully slow, going over basic science that for anyone interested in this topic is very well known common knowledge. 

Right away I realised who this show is aimed at.... And its not people who are even remotely educated. 

Now lets jump to the real meat of the problem.

The depictions and explanations of the alien wildlife are utterly nonsensical and do not conform to the well established norms of evolution or scientific understanding. 

While interesting the aliens only have the most vague of biological understanding of that of a random scifi tv show. Where you wouldnt need to go into the details for the sake of story plot. Why do these creatures fly? Because the writers say so. 

The very first assumption that these sky whales have 2 sexes is utterly insane. The only reason most creatures on earth have 2 sexes is because the earliest forms of life here evolved to have 2 sexes, and that then carried on to this day. nothing more. There is NO reason there couldnt be more or no sex at all. In fact its far more likely that alien creatures would reproduce asexually. 

Another issue I had was with the sky whales main predator. Some hydrogen filled balloon arsed leaches.... really WTF! Its soo far out the left field it too falls under poor science fiction.

Again the more likely predator would be another type of sky whale like creature. As it is with any other form of evolution. Most predators to mammals are other mammal.

Then there is the birthing of the creature.... Again WTF, that is utterly nonsensical to evolution again.

Yes sacrificial birthing happens in nature here too. But not when there is so few offspring and not with such large an animal that it takes huge amounts of energy to grow into that creature. 

Evolution simply does not work like that. Because its NOT viable. 

Oh and the frankly the most cringey moment I had was during the bug close up sex money shots!

With the film maker getting excited over it.

I come from a film background. I knew about slow up studio setups like this. And this isnt to slight the photographers. This kinda work is great and the BBC nature department does it all the time.

But the way this was edited together and shown for ... almost shock value? Cant think of the word I'm looking for. It really was cheap.

I might watch the second episode but I suspect it would be my last. 

Oh and Just want to say... The BBC actually did a show similar to this roughly 20 or so years ago. A what would life be like on other planets.... And I distinctly remember they didnt need to dumb down the science on that show, and they took the time to explain the likely biology of alien life in a clear and detailed way. 

&amp;#x200B;

So yes... Sadly regardless of the CG work gone into this, on scientific merit this show is utter garbage. You wont learn anything useful here, and in fact you may end up dumber by the end of it. 

Such a shame.","Alien Worlds , My thought going by the first episode I just watched. Its utter nonsensical garbage!"

netflix,"Are the plans of Netflix worth the money each month. If the content isn’t improved should the plan price decrease. 

- Basic Plan £5.99 Per Month
- Standard Plan £8.99 Per Month
- Premium Plan £11.99 Per Month

The basic plan includes one user watching at one time with one device having downloads, HD not available. For a whopping £3 extra per month, two users can watch at the same time and two users can have downloads and you can watch in HD. The price for this should be a £2 increase and the price should be £5.99 a month for this plan which means the basic plan should be £3.99. This would be a brilliant plan service. And all plans should include a three month free service if purchased for one whole year in advance. The premium plan allows you to watch and download on 4 devices and 4 users can watch at the same time, 4K is available but you must have a 4K Advice. Hmm, the devices and users watching should be unlimited at this price. This should be a £3 increase. But the price should be £8.99 not £11.99 the prices should be decreased by £2-£3 and the premium plan should have unlimited users watching at the same time.

It started stuttering really bad and skipping frames, as if it was only running at 20fps or even less. Once I moved the window to my main screen, everything was fine but when I moved it back it started stuttering again.

Season 3 and also other shows like South Park or Family Guy (earlier and later seasons) look fine on the second monitor, no stuttering, so far it only seems to be season 4 that's acting up. Edit: No stutters with season 4 if I use Firefox instead of the desktop app.

Mank was so humorous that I couldn’t imagine he wrote Citizen Kane, yet it still makes sense cause “rosebud” requires experiences like Mank to write. To me rosebud is just a word, to apologize for what the man did, and to sum up his life. I really appreciate the black and white, the lines, and the fade out between scenes.

I feel like the characters are pulled straight from trending social media personalities without modification.

I mean I get applying relatable trends to your shows to make them appealing but it almost feels lacking in creativity. I feel like I already know the character before the character even does anything because I've seen it on social media thousands of times (specifically referencing the gardener in Bly Manor. She felt very copy and pasted from Instagram or Twitter)  not that there is anything wrong or uncreative about people with these personalities but I guess my personal opinion is that it makes for bad and boring TV.

This never used to happen as I have fallen asleep on every series",Twilight Zone
netflix,"I love a good anthology series, and everyone seems to at least love Black Mirror. But there's different tones you can hit on in a good anthology series. It doesn't always have to be scary, mind-bending, or deep. It can also be funny, touching, or just non stop action. For example, in the absence of Black Mirror I binge watched the following : LD&amp;R, Room 104, Creep-show, Outer Limits, and a few episodes of others. Sometimes I would watch these shows on one TV, while playing classic video games on another.

So it gave me an idea for a dope series that would be a platform for actors, writers, directors, and even a streaming service, to experiment with different IP's in a safe ""one off"" environment that requires no commitment to a full series, or second episode, unless the fans rejoice and demand it.

The series could explore a live action interpretation of a different video game IP every episode. So if they could get the rights to do it, a potential season line up could look like :

Episode 1 - Zaxxon

Episode 2 - Centipede

Episode 3 - Ninja Gaiden

Episode 4 - Double Dragon

Episode 5 - Spy Hunter

Episode 6 - Dead Space

That's just an example of course, not my dream team line up. I don't think it's realistic to assume they'd be able to get the rights to the most iconic IP's. At least not right away. If the series was successful enough, then you might see a trend of license holders willing to let their IP be represented in the show for a single episode.

Personally I would love to see a 1 hour rendition of Metroid, Mario Bros, or Legend of Zelda, in live action. And since Netflix already has the rights to a Castlevania series, I can assume it's somewhat realistic to imagine at least one live action episode based in that world.

So here's the catch (but also the benefit). A 1 hour long episode will not be able to summarize the entire depth of the character, or see resolution to their full story arc, or see the entire story of the video game unfold in live action. And I think that's a good thing. Too many Video Game IP deals go bad because they over commit in the beginning when they haven't even figured out how to represent the material in a digestible way. Then they are locked in to a weak representation of the IP that no one likes. At that point it doesn't matter if the deal was made for 1 episode or a movie, or 24 episodes. If it's bad then it's bad. The ""one off"" anthology approach is perfect. It allows people to experiment with an IP creatively and not be locked in to demanding framework like ""character arc"", and ""origin story"", and ""slow build up"" and so one. They also have a limited time to focus on one interesting aspect of that character's world and adventures. 

When my mind started swirling with ideas like this, I was fascinated by the potential episodes. Key moments or story arcs that happened within a small portion of an IP's total story, or universe.

Like the moment when Alucard nears the end of his adventure in Castlevania : Symphony of the Night, and has to face off with a succubus who makes him dream of his long lost mother.

Like when the giant centipede first attacks from centipede. Which could be a misdirection episode that builds up with character actor driven comedy, or drama, and results in a surprise ending with a giant centipede.

The moment when Link discovers the secret to an ancient flute that summons a whirlwind to take him further on his quest. 

The worlds are endless, the interpretations are near infinite. There would never be a moment in the series where the producers had to admit defeat and say ""we've run out of material"". 

Even if the series just focused on more affordable IP's in the beginning it would still be an almost endless well of material. The less established games actually provide MORE room for story, action, characters, that may have not been in the original game. 

I would love to see live action episodes featuring Rygar (Tecmo), Karnov (Data East), Black Tiger (Capcom). But maybe I wouldn't want to see a whole series on them, or even a full length movie. That's the beauty of the anthology format for these IP's. And if something doesn't work, then we just won't speak of it again, and we'll thank our lucky stars it was only a single episode.

Now finally before giving me your feedback, consider the framework for telling the stories in each episode. I had an idea of a siblings trying to survive some kind of apocalypse and there is no electricity anymore. Every night the older brother tells the younger sibling a story based on some old video game he used to play. He doesn't know any traditional bedtime stories but he knows all these games he's played growing up. Every episode is a different story the older brother would tell. This gives a bit of artistic license possibly, as it's not the IP directly being represented as is, but it's another character's version of it spun into a bed time story of some kind. This could be a set up for story used once, or every episode, or never. Just an idea. Although if this set up was used it could wrap the entire season up into one nice little story within a story and show us that they were in a video game IP all along. Some futuristic apocalyptic one. It could even turn out to be centipede lol. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the first episode, they have a creature that lands to lay it's eggs and dies. No natal care. They then go on to show how clever they are by comparing this to meerkats, which have a heavy investment of natal care as a species. A better example would have been an octopus, which lays it's eggs in a crevice or tiny hole in the ocean and then dies. Or the various salmonids that die after spawning. The main issue with a comparison like this, however, is that in order to ensure enough young survive to sexual maturity, they lay lots of eggs (some fish lay literally millions of eggs). The weird sky creature they depict doesn't appear to lay more than 20. Secondly, she dies right on top of the eggs.

netflix,"I really liked the show, but found the last episode a bit of a tone shift. Most of the series is pretty gritty and grounded, for the most part. It's obviously super character based, and does a great job of that. Beth is a really compelling character in the story. 

That said, I feel like the realistic tone and gritty drama atmosphere leaves as soon as she gets to Moscow. Then it suddenly takes a very Young Adult fiction atmosphere. The scenes with the crowds, all her friends getting together at the last minute, and even just things like the commentary and music were really campy. It felt more like a Harry Potter or Hunger Games film. 

A little disappointing. I didn't expect a dramatic ending, but I didn't expect it to go from Rocky I to Rocky IV in tone so quickly.",Did anyone else find the last episode of Queen's Gambit kind of weird?

I like the balance of logic and emotion in this series. I'm the type of ghost show viewer who always has the ""Why is there a ghost? What happened?

This is a real bummer, because I really loved the show so far and heard S1 is supposed to end in a cliffhanger.
I really hope I can get some of you to watch it and if it becomes popular in Europe, maybe NA watchers will really give it a chance and like it as well!

netflix,"Hello everyone, today I was looking through Google if it's possible to share an account with someone from another country and the latest posts/links were from 2019. I prefer to be sure about this before buying a plan. 

Until November we were sharing an account with another friend (5 shared spaces, everyone Polish), he decided to cancel his subscription. We've decided to buy a 5 people plan as well and one of the interested people is my friend from Spain (to be exact, Catalunya). 

I've been finding mostly ""yes, you can share it with people from other countries"" although the first Google article is a big ""No"" from an US citizen (comment from 2017). 

I've read Netflix's ToS in Polish and then just in case re-read in English. The only rule I found was ""4.3. You may view Netflix content primarily within the country in which you have established your account and only in geographic locations where we offer our service and have licensed such content"". I know our libraries will be different and we don't care about that, it's just the matter of ""is it possible"". In my eyes, ""primarily"" doesn't mean ""exclusively"" so I'm thinking it should be fine for me to share account with her. Another friend said people were getting banned over this in the past, so I have my doubts now and that's why I'm asking.

netflix,"So I've just finished binging Nerflx's Queen Gambit. First I've got to say that it kept me to the screen (over 4 days) so I don't consider it as a bad show. But (!) I find this show to be extremely disappointing of what it could have been. Felt like there wasn't enough emphasis on the chess itself. In most of the matches, all you see are the people with some split screens that suppose to make you excited (I guess?). Ok, so there were a few glances on the board itself, but it said nothing to anyone not familiar with the game.

I think the most challenging part of this show is to get people that aren't interested in chess to watch and enjoy it. I feel like they chose the easy way to do it by simply not putting emphasis on the game itself, without even explaining what is so exciting about some of the moves the players have made.    
Ok, so I know a bit of chess and I get it that many people don't, but take out the chess and put ANYTHING, and you could keep the show exactly the same. Come on, at least do some cool visual effects on the board to let the audience know about what is so cool with the moves, how it traps the opponent. Nada. 

All the series was going on neutral, without any real climax or suspense. Going into a show that you know how will it end should at least gives you some strong ups and downs through it.  Overall I think it's not bad at all, but I think it's way more overrated than what it needs to be.",[SPOILERS] Queen Gambit is disappointing

So, when I was younger, around 2012, 2014, I remember watching a show on netflix. It wasn’t famous, I think, and it had only one season. I think it was an original British Netflix show too. It was about a man who lived in a trailer with his butler and a female dog, not a normal dog, she used glasses, and read books, and the show didn’t had much episodes, as I remember. There was one episode where he (the man which I don’t remember the name) would go fishing, and other where he would do something with pottery, I think. Im almost sure that the title of the show was the guys name, and it had a very cool opening. The opening starts showing a castle, to make people think the guy is rich, and then shows his trailer, and the characters starts to sing in gibberish, cause the characters in the show didnt speak normal language, it was something like gibberish.

netflix,"Hi all, on my iPhone X, the Netflix app sometimes shows videos in a 4:3 aspect ratio. This often cuts off a good portion of the left and right hand sides of the video (depending on the original ratio). I can get around this by pinching in. This makes the sides pop out to the correct ratio, but the bottom and top get cut off (if it’s not widescreen).

Since upgrading to iOS 14, I have been able to us PiP with the correct aspect ratio, but when going back into the app it goes back to the 4:3 ratio. 

This has been happening on and off for a long time (probably almost 2 years at this point), so I rule out any OS changes causing this. 

I also can’t figure out any pattern to which shows/movies it decides to make 4:3. I have deleted and redownloaded the apps multiple times to no avail.

TV is my vice, I really enjoy a great TV show. I felt the Netflix subscription was worth every penny. 
This year however, the price went up and I feel like there have been entire months where nothing interesting came out. 
On top of that, a few of my favorite shows got discontinued. I have some Netflix Original animes I am scared to look up in fear I find they have been cancelled too. 
I have watched a lot of foreign/international shows and movies to make up for it, maybe in genres that werent my first choice. I don't wish to complain, as I appreciate these shows a lot and they've fulfilled my cravings for good TV. However I miss when it was back to back scifi releases, and the writing quality was really high.

Also, who keeps hiring Julian Dennison? The guy can not act his way out of a paper bag. I would say he’s a words actor than Ruby Rose, but that isn’t a hard feat to pull off. That guy was definitely hired because of the way he looks. It was a diversity hire, certainly not a talent one.

They do the deed and a storm which the 2nd in command predicted up to the second comes in 1hr early. That's when the commander asks the 2nd to follow her, cause she has a plan. Which obviously she won't tell, playing the 'haha you don't trust me' game as well.

Here are 3 great reasons to come back to Netflix:

Me: No there is nothing available at Netflix, all shows have been canceled or finished. Only foreigns are out there and very low quality productions recently after 2018 and by canceling Marvel Shows (not your fault but producing low quality shows is your fault)

•	Rewatch old favourites. We've saved your viewing history so you can pick up where you left off.

Me: No?! Who does that and for a new price?!

•	Download and go. That way you can watch Netflix even without Wi-Fi.

My partner and I have different TV tastes so have never really got on with a series we both like. However we recently started watching house of cards, she’s really into it, I was surprised and glad, because I was too.

netflix,"I'm just gonna tag this with spoiler and nsfw.

First, let's talk dialog.   It's cheesy.  It's soo cheesy.   But it's also boring cheesy.   We first watched Bruce Willis action movies for lines like ""Yippie Ki Yay, Mother Fucker!!""  Here we get lines like ""Stop.  I'll give you the code.""   I think that is literally the longest and strongest line he has in the entire movie.

It's like the entire script was generated by Alexa, Siri, and Cortana when asked ""what are lines from an action movie?""

Then there is the plot.  Spoiler alert: an international terrorist with unlimited funding and unlimited minions to sacrifice has a Bad Thing and a billionaires daughter as a hostage.  Does billionaire contact the US government, to get Seal Team Six, the CIA, the NSA, Jack Ryan, or Jason Bourne involved?   NOPE!!   He goes to his completely incompetent chief of security to hire a barbershop-quartet of former commandos-turned-mercenaries with no real equipment or backing.   Then they deceive them into falling into the same trap that he knows is a trap but where somehow he is the bait.  The result is the terrorist has already scoped out the environment, placed security cameras, basically has the whole place surrounded.

Then there is the action.   Lots of gun battles.  Good guys never miss, bad guys (almost) always miss.  Also, good guys and their wounded retreat to some super-secret room they found by accident, that again somehow the bad guys, despite having had blueprints to the entire site (there's that whole plot thing again!), somehow cannot find!

Finally, production and continuity was sooo bad.  Starting from the limo at the beginning, which didn't have a door up front from the outside, but everyone enters the limo from the door up front.  To characters somehow walking down spiral stairs in some kind of tower, immediately after being in the basement.

Last point, Bruce Willis.  He glares.  A lot.   He glares while sitting in a limo.  He glares while sitting in a chair.   He glares while standing alone in a closet.   I can only guess when he got the final version of the script, he hated it so much he refused to participate.","Hard Kill is a hot mess. So sad it ""stars"" Bruce Willis"

The titles left are a mix of both shows and movies but are usually mostly Netflix originals, although some Netflix originals disappear and some of the few still there are not Netflix originals. 

Does anyone know why this happens or have any clue of a fix for it?",Does anyone else notice their list changes sometimes or many shows/movies disappear for awhile without doing anything to it?

netflix,"While the movie isn't perfect, it far exceeded my expectations. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau is *fantastic* in this film, everyone knows him as Jaime Lannister, but he fell right into the role of Money. Seeing his descent from innocent businessman to skinhead gang leader is brutal to watch. Going into the film I thought it would just be another violent B-movie, but the production is honestly stellar. The cinematography, the score, the special effects, and the acting are all superb. Most films have an underlying ""theme"" that is usually second to its entertainment value, but Shot Caller did a tremendous job showcasing how hard it is for someone to truly get rehabilitated in prison. Nikolaj's character is just doing what he has to to survive and protect his family, all the way up to becoming the head-honcho. It's been a long time that I was so invested in the world of a movie that I was sad when the credits rolled, simply because I wasn't ready to leave.

&amp;#x200B;

Narratively I understand the movie is pretty divided. The film doesn't go to great depths to explore all of Money's decisions or what exactly his motives are, but I thought it was adequate enough, and it all made sense to me. Other than the dumb title and the aforementioned narrative flaws, I think it's a perfect film. I really don't think it gets the recognition it deserves, but from what I understand, that stems from distribution issues. If you are a fan of prison movies, I can't recommend this enough.

With prices going up again by another $2 bringing their 4K tier to nearly $20 a month, and cancelling nearly all their best shows while producing and renewing a lot of bad ones, how can they consider this acceptable?  Is anyone else noticing this on streaming boxes or just mostly when watching from your computers?",Netflix looks like trash in the last week or so

netflix,"Just some points before I start:

* I am using the Windows 10 app
* I have a native 4k display
* The resolution is set to 4k60Hz
* I have a supported GPU (at least I think: 1070 Ti)
* The GPU, monitor, and cable all supports HDMI 2.0 
* ...Meaning not a bandwidth issue (I have also tested in other content)
* I have paid for and installed HEVC video extensions

And with all of that, I am still only getting HDR content on Netflix, NOT 4k. There is no ""Ultra HD"" tag on any content on Netflix, and the max I can get is 1080pHDR. I have confirmed this by using the debug stats, no matter how long I wait, it never transforms to 4kHDR. And since I forgot to mention, yes I have enough network speed for it.

And also, like I said above, I have enough bandwidth for it, the monitor supports HDMI 2.1, the GPU supports HDMI 2.0, and the cable is HDMI 2.0 certified. HDMI 2.0 has enough bandwidth for 4k, 60Hz, HDR, at 4:2:2 12 bit. I haven't had any other issues with any other content either. So NOT a bandwidth issue.

And yes, again, I have installed HEVC video extensions. Though I really shouldn't have to state this at all considering i'm playing HDR in the first place, but I know it will come up in the comments somewhere, which is why I would like to reiterate.

netflix,,google cuties and scroll down to send feedback to Google. the description needs to be changed immediately!!!!
netflix,"I have given this series several attempts now and good lord. It is abysmal. 

So before I dive into my rant, the reason why I’ve tried to watch it several times is because it has so many of the things I love. Horror, mystery, supernatural/fantasy elements. Not to mention it is littered with great and established actors and actresses. 

Now that being said, I watched the first two seasons when they originally aired because my girlfriend loved it. To me, there were brief moments of intrigue or suspense but mostly it was one eye-roll after another. I stopped watching after that. 

A couple years later, my friend convinced me to watch the “Freak Show” season, after he repeatedly told me how awesome it was. I lasted three episodes and again, it was painful. So many cliches, poor dialog, predictable events, etc. Not to mention I hated the setting of that season. I chalked it up as a loss and never looked back. 

Now in 2020, Netflix has been shoving it in my face for days now. As I originally stated, this is definitely the type of show/movie I normally watch, so I get why their algorithm is ramming it down my throat. I reluctantly decided to start watching it yesterday.

Started with “Hotel”. Got bored before the second episode ended. Tried to watch the season with Cuba Gooding Jr (forget the name) and it was so bad that I nearly stopped there. The Apocalypse season was also laughably terrible. 

I decided to give it one more shot just now and watched 3 episodes of “1984”. Holy shit, that was also downright trash. 

So after watching two full seasons and pieces of several more, these are my observations:

1. The script and dialog are absolutely terrible. Even when there is a briefly captivating moment, it’s usually ruined by some cheesy and basic dialog. 

2. I have NEVER found a single character that I liked. No one to root for. No one who I want to live and succeed. Couldn’t care less about ANY of them. Obviously that’s a problem in a series where people are dying every episode. 

3. The stories are so uninteresting and this largely goes back to my second point, the characters are garbage. I don’t care about their backstories. The central plot is always just a “meh, if it happens, it happens” type of feeling. 

4. Even when I suffered through the episodes to get to a big reveal or finale, it was lame as fuck. The mysteries all wind up being nonsense, the big reveals are idiotic and again, I NEVER GAVE A SHIT ABOUT THE CHARACTERS. If you can’t even get mildly invested in the protagonists, what the hell is the point? 

There are many other gripes I have with this damn show but I don’t want to ramble on further. If you like it, I’m happy you get enjoyment from it. I don’t however and I was so frustrated with it that I had to make this post to vent my frustration.

netflix,"So I subbed to a premium plan this month since I bought a 4k monitor for myself, I thought ""hey, I should treat myself to the best quality possible"". Little did I know, that to achieve that quality I would have to jump through 10 burning hoops and do a somersault. 

Apparently, just paying for the plan and having a 4k monitor is not enough. Here's a list of things that you also need:

1. The right browser (Edge) or the native windows app
2. A monitor that supports HDCP 2.2  and a cable that supports it
3. A codec from windows store that costs $1 for some reason
4. The latest windows update
5. Connection speed of at least 25 mbps (this one is pretty obvious, but I thought that you could download videos in 4K. Disclaimer: you can't, downloads are capped at 1080p)
6. If you have multiple monitors, and one of them doesn't support 4K/HDCP 2.2, you can't stream in 4K, even if you primary monitor is compatible

And on top of this, there is never an indicator of the quality of the video (like in YouTube for example), so you can never tell if the video just doesn't have a 4K version, or your setup is wrong. There is no easy way to troubleshoot your setup. But the most annoying thing is, all these little things are **NOT MENTIONED** on the official website anywhere. For some reason, 3rd party websites have to provide this information.

So basically, there is this list of not so obvious requirements for you to stream in 4K, but Netflix doesn't care to make sure you can actually get what you paid for. I personally think this is ridiculous. It's like ""yeah, we got your money, now go figure it out yourself if you want 4K that bad"". For $16/month, they should have a bloody hotline for people with these issues honestly, and a wiki page.

netflix,"Okay, this post is coming from someone who grew up around parents, teachers, and piers who looked down upon television yet loved books. In response, here are the similarities between television and books:

1. They are both sedentary entertainment media
2. They can both convey complex plot and character development within fiction 
3. They can both be used as tools for education
4. Depending on the program, a TV show can use the same vernacular as a written piece (Think David Attenborough documentary)

If they are so similar, why do readers tease television watchers? Why can't we enjoy what we enjoy? Why can't we try another form of media? 

Is this elitism?",Why do book readers insult Netflix enjoyers?

Heres the very little information I know:

 \- I believe it's international... The voices of the characters sounded like they might be voice overs.

\-Possibly set in the victorian era...perhaps maybe about royalty

\-In the scene there is a man shooting plates or birds and there is a woman telling him that some other man is back and that she couldn't believe she was being set up to marry him. The man seemed disgruntled about it almost like he was jealous of her

\-I think there were two men on the cover. Might be LGBTQ (but that can change at any moment)

Seems like a lot of people know a family going through this, or donated to a go fund me, but this doc really lays out what these people are going through that a lot of people don't want to think about.

An interesting element of the film is the denial of the parents, and the amount of power they have over the treatment over their child, even when doctors don't agree.  I don't blame these parents, I kinda understand it, but one family in particular is in such denial, and trying to avoid all real conversations by making stupid unfunny jokes, that you really feel for the staff and step mom trying to talk some sense into them as gently as possible.

netflix,"I recently watched Dark, a German series which I thoroughly enjoyed.  Most of the voice acting was ok but some of it way off (actresses who sounded 30 talking for old ladies etc) but today I’ve started Love and Anarchy and it’s almost unwatchable. It seems like all of the voice actors have forgotten the “actor” part of the job description. The dialogue is so unnatural and the voices seem so off (the main actress sounds like some kind of stoned preppy cheerleader when clearly she’s meant to be a commanding business woman and her genuine Swedish voice is much deeper). It honestly sounds like high school drama, the way they read from the scripts in such a forced way. I’ve never done any voice over work so I don’t know what challenges they face but do they not get to at least see the scene so they’re acting for? Sometimes the “acting” will be so dramatic compared to what’s actually happening on screen. Other times it’s the opposite. It absolutely grates me and makes a good series practically unwatchable in my opinion. Surely Netflix have the budget for slightly higher quality voice actors?!",I wish they’d hire better voice actors for dubbed series

netflix,"This is going to be long, but hopefully worth your time.

First, the basics. HDR - obvious. SDR - standard dynamic range. SDR screen means a regular, non-HDR tv/monitor.

Common misconception is that HDR is all about brightness - that's true only to a degree. HDR content has both higher maximum brightness as well as higher precision within smaller dynamic range, but that higher brightness is used mostly for really bright light sources.

Another common misconception is that you need the brightest possible HDR screen to do HDR content justice. That higher brightness will show those bright spots better, but if your screen isn't 1000 nits, but for example 600 or even less, it does NOT mean that everything should get darker because of it. That's not how it works. HDR-capable video player, for example built-in netflix player in your tv, is calibrated towards your screen. In case of a PC, you need to take care of that calibration yourself. Basically, video player needs to know your screen's maximum brightness to display HDR content properly. If there are details in the picture that are very bright, for example between 800 and 1000 nits, and your screen's maximum brightness is 600, those details will suffer (they won't be gone though, because of the tone mapping), but everything else will be just fine.

But here's the thing. SDR content is expected to be 100 nits max. Blame the old crt tvs and so on, that's how it is to this day. As a result, tv content is mastered with that in mind - that most of the picture should be within 100 nits range. People that don't have HDR tvs, usually are watching it at a much higher brightness - minimum for inexpensive SDR tvs/monitors these days is around 250-300 nits. Picture gets blown out of proportion contrast-wise, colors get messed up, but it looks ""punchy"" and reasonable, so everyone got used to it.

SDR content has no notion of brightness higher than 100 nits.

HDR can go much, much higher.

But how is HDR tv content mastered? Similarly to SDR content... so that the average is around 100 nits.

That's why, when you're used to watching SDR movies at 300 nits, when you'll watch something in HDR that's mastered towards 100 nits average (to have huge headroom for much brighter highlights), it seems darker - because IT IS, compared to how you were watching things in SDR. The whole industry should throw that 100 nits standard out of the window and start mastering things towards 200 nits at least, but that's just IMHO. It is what it is, it's not HDR's fault.

But here's another thing, it isn't exactly worse. Sometimes the picture may seem just darker, but often there's higher relative contrast between different things, not even mentioning wider color gamut and higher precision.

Below are 3 series of 3 screenshots each. First one is SDR - standard, maximum brightness SDR. Second one is SDR displayed at 100 nits on a 250 nits SDR screen. Third one is HDR tonemapped to 250 nits - meaning, whatever is in the HDR content that's below 250 nits, gets reproduced accurately, while everything above gets ""squeezed"" to the top of that 250 range. This is SDR screenshot, so HDR color precision is lost there, but you should be able to get a fairly realistic idea about the difference between SDR and HDR in this case, even if you have only SDR screen. Also, it gets obvious that HDR content targets 100 nits on average when it comes to the average brightness - confirming the above ""why is it so dark"" explanation.

First series:

Hard to tell how HDR is any better at all, right? Next one then:

[https://i.imgur.com/FssG9Ep.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/FssG9Ep.jpeg)

Now here it is quite obvious. Second SDR screenshot is the same as the first one, only darker. While the brighter version may look fine, in reality it's just a blown out of proportion low contrast picture compared to HDR.

And the last one - warning, very slightly NSFW.

The difference is obvious.

""But every tv has a brightness setting, what will happen if I'll crank it up to the max?""

Well, that depends on your tv's maximum brightness. HDR content needs much higher brightness for highlights. If your tv has a maximum brightness of 600 nits, the average brightness for the examples above may go up from 100 nits to roughly 125 nits max, meaning it'll still be considerably darker than SDR content displayed on the same tv. That's just the way it works. Screen with a maximum brightness of 1000 nits would bump up that average brightness to 200 nits at best. Also, how the tv interprets that brightness setting on its maximum level, most likely depends on the tv. HDR content specifies exact brightness of each pixel of the picture, up to 1000 nits and more. If the tv bumps up the reference 100 nits brightness up to 200, it has less headroom to properly show those brightest spots, partially defeating the whole purpose of HDR.

""But you've said that less maximum brightness doesn't mean darker picture!"" - as long as the display is calibrated properly, 100 nits is 100 nits, wether your screen's maximum brightness is 600 or 1000. Highlights will be darker, but everything else should be fine. What you're losing in such case is the ability to crank up the overall brightness higher (which rises the requirements to show highlights properly). It doesn't mean the picture is wrong - as I've said, SDR is supposed to be 100 nits, and HDR content for tv on average is around that value as well. Everything else is just multiplying the reference, and because of the nature of HDR, you need a much brighter screen if that's what you want.

My personal take is that such wide dynamic range (content targeting 100 nits on average with even 1000 nits highlights) is an overkill and they should target 200 nits on average at least. It is what it is though. Also, you shouldn't compare tv content to ""HDR demos"" from youtube - which target much higher brightness on average - or to the output from games, which often have HDR setting to choose your screen's maximum brightness so the game can adjust to it on the fly, while targeting higher than 100 nits brightness on average as well.

Hopefully this clears things up a bit. HDR is great, just perhaps a bit underutilized so far.","""I have a HDR screen and it's all so dark"" explanation - no, it's not exactly your screen's fault"

3. The style of animation and the awkwardness/stiffness of character interactions evokes the 80s.

netflix,"I just finished the series in less than 2 days and I loved every minute of it and I think you'd love it too.

Honestly it's one of the best netflix originals ever and clearly the best of the year. There are several reasons for that. Its subject can be pretty surprising and off-putting to some (not me though, always loved chess so I was intrigued from the start!) but it's handled with such talent and efficiency that even if you don't even know the rules, you won't get bored. The chess matches are so well done and are genuinely exciting but that's also because there is so much more to it. It's a story about resilience and trusting yourself and become the master of your own fate, which, granted, sounds a bit cheesy but honestly.. it's just very inspiring. They also touch on so many other subjects with class, subtlety and restraint and it's just delightful and drives the point home.

Everything about her story is interesting and captivating and the excellent Anya Taylor-Joy (who I have loved ever since The VVitch) just makes the story shine. Her performance is stellar, with a heavy focus on attitude, facial expressions and body language which makes her acting so incredibly good and honestly ? Worthy of all the awards she could get. She's insanely talented the story really lets her flex her acting muscles and gives a nuanced and electric performance. 

The solitude she faced is perfectly conveyed through the directing, the music and her acting that it can almost be overwhelming. It can be pretty sad but they never overdo it.  It's genuinely beautiful and enthralling to see her progress through her career and form new connections and to see her relationships evolve. Nothing ever feels gratuitous, **the writing is superb. It's incredibly subtle and understated but it's so perfectly written that it just amplifies every emotion they want to convey.** The dialogues and the acting are **great** too. So is the directing, the photography, and the sets and costumes which are absolutely gorgeous. And the music.... the music is incredible, poignant at times, exciting and thrilling when it needs to be. **It is superb work they've done here**.

Honestly I could just go on and on about it, it's just a really great show. It's real and genuine and the ending might be the best ending to a miniseries I've ever seen ?

netflix,"I personally find it dumb you're forced to fast forward or watch the intro on this show.

netflix,"First of all I want to say that I consider Netflix a horrible value proposition especially now with so many other streaming services competing which dilutes the value even more. I always try to get the free month and cancel before payments due since I barely end up using it anywau but this time I slipped up and they got me, I checked my bank account to see $17.65 charged. Now what the fuck now? I thought it was really pushing it when it was $12 something but this is obscene. I literally only got it to binge watch cobra kai. The vast majority of netflix library, like 95% of original content is unwatchable trash that makes me miss the good old days of cable(ok I'm exaggerating here). But I'm really at a loss for words here. At least with amazon prime video I feel like I'm getting something for my money. I just went on netflix to see if anything looks good to watch and now I'm a mixture of frustrated and disappointed. Almost 18 bucks a month for this... I hope people get fed up cancel their subscriptions and thus lame company goes out of business. We deserve better",Netflix is robbing me and I don't appreciate it

netflix,"I just thought I’d tell a story some of you may enjoy from two years ago that happens to involve my Mexican Grandmother, and the tv show “Breaking Bad”.

My Grandmother, who we call “Mami Lupe”, lives in Mexico. But every other year she comes and spends a few weeks to a month here at our house here in Texas for and extended stay. 

This specific time was in August 2018, where she stayed for a month.

And during one of the weeks she was here, with my Mom having to leave for work from 8-5 during the week. During that time I was home more often than not since of my college classes were online during that time. So in essence I was here keeping her company so she wouldn’t get bored.

I’d try and find stuff we could watch together on Netflix so that she wouldn’t either take a nap or sit reading the Spanish tabloid she’d brought with her on her trip . As is with Netflix most of the time, it’s always toss up with what subtitles and dubs are available for its library content. 

So I thought “Why not show her Breaking Bad?”. Now years ago, I’d binged a majority of the show on Netflix. Which I was then able to see Season 5B as it aired live back in 2013.

I searched “Breaking Bad” and clicked on it to start playing on Episode 1. And As soon as the first episode’s opening scene showed with the fade-in of the desert cactus. I went to top and saw what was available as far as subtitles and language dubs.

I figured only Spanish subtitles would be available. But to my surprise a Spanish dub was also there, which I happily clicked. 

More so because my Grandmother at that time was 85. And I knew there was no way the show would keep her attention long enough if she had to read subtitles for an extended period of time.

And sure enough she was semi-into it the first couple episodes. Then once Tuco showed up that’s when she went from casual viewer to fully onboard. Once my mom arrived from work that day even she noticed how into the show my Grandmother was.

That night we had to stop watching it around early into the second season. The following morning, my Grandmother eventually asked me if I could put it on for her as she was really getting into it. And I being a Breaking Bad fan, I happily obliged.

And over the next few days we eventually binged the whole series. Which for me was funny in that this was going to be my second time watching the show from beginning to end. And I was watching it in Spanish (which I understand) but siting there with her made it that much more enjoyable.

My mom eventually chided both my Grandmother and I for not doing much else here while at home. But my Grandmother wanted to keep the binge going. And I of course was not going to stop her.

There’s multiple moments that stand out as far as her reaction. But for length I’ll name one of my favorites. 

From the “Fly” episode, after realizing that the it would revolve around a fly she eventually came to say “pues esa mugre mosca, como no la pueden Matar”. (“That damn fly, why don’t they just kill it”)

She enjoyed most of the characters on the show. “Gus”, “Walt”, and “Mike”. 

But the one that stood out to her most was “Jessie”. And his character arc was one that once it arrived at the end she was about as invested as anything that came before it.

Of course once we finished it. I thought well hell, why not get her into “Better Call Saul”. But It didn’t take long to realize she just wasn’t going to be into it as much as she was with “Breaking Bad”.

Which having seen “Better Call Saul” since it first started airing, I love it just as much as “Breaking Bad”. But I eventually realized the fact that it was a prequel, my Grandmother just wasn’t going to be into it.

Earlier this year pre-covid shutdown she visited us again for an extended period of time. And I figured maybe she’d enjoy continuing watching Jessie’s story in “El Camino”. 

But unfortunately so much time had passed that she really didn’t have much recollection of Jessie character arc that from Breaking Bad.

Last week, as she was visiting the house of one of my uncles (her son) she suffered a heart attack/stroke. And since then she’s been interned at nearby hospital.

And Earlier Today, things took a turn for the worse and she suffered two more mini heart attacks and our family has been told it’s just a matter of hours she has left until she passes.

I just decided to write this as a way of focusing the grief I’m feeling into a tribute to my Grandmother (as tiny as it may be). Which I find myself laughing and crying while writing this because watching the entire “Breaking Bad” series in Spanish with my Grandmother over the course of a few days is something I’ll never forget. 

But I find comfort in having shared those special few days with her where we got to watch would I (and what I think a majority of us would consider to be) one of the greatest Television shows ever made.

So for that I not only want to Thank the Creators and everyone involved with the “Breaking Bad” Universe. But to Netflix also, for having subtitles and dubs for other Languages that allowed for us the opportunity to bond watching it.","Netflix, Breaking Bad, and my Mexican Grandmother"

Why not add a setting to auto-skip intro on tv shows? 

Netflix doesn't care about you watching the credits, as they auto-play episodes 7 or so seconds after the show ends. However we have to stop every 20 to 50 minutes to skip the intro. Its just a quality of life enchancement for Netflix users that I came up with watching stuff.

netflix,,"Netflix, I know you're doing this on purpose."
netflix,"Ok so couple days back I started watching this series, I was told that the story line is really good. And I love a well written show/movie.

It had me hooked till 4th episode I think but man after that I completely lost interest. Why you ask?

Firstly, the story line goes for a toss and you are forced to wrap your head around the jumping timelines and the characters repeatedly saying, "" I have been tucked away in a memory again "".

Secondly, there are a lot of loop holes and so many questionable situations. The characters are not reacting to some awfully weird things. They are simply playing along to this madness.

All in all, the actors walks too slow, they talk too show, the camera moment is also really slow. I mean, it came to a point that everything became too predictable and a bit annoying and not scary at all. What annoyed me the most was the never ending repeated scenes, Dani breathing heavily, kids running where ever they feel like, and their Uncle's alter ego? I mean. Did not sign up for this.

PS: It possibly could be just my opinion but I really truly felt that way about it. No offense to it's fans or to the people who actually like it.

netflix,"I'm an avid fan of horror shows, and unfortunately I'm catching up thanks to both COVID haze (time dilation, not actual COVID) so I just marathoned ""The Haunting of Hill House"" for the last two days.

First off, there is no correlation between ""The Haunting of Hill House"" and ""The Legend of Hell House"" (the 1973 paranormal horror movie).  It took a couple of episodes of the movie's 10-episode sprint to make that clear however it is my opinion that ""The Haunting of Hill House"" is a movie series that should be held in the same echelon of ""The Legend of Hell House"".

The movie's story arc is spread across 10 60 minute (on average) episodes and paints the interconnected story of the five children (Steven, Shirley, Theo, Luke, Nell) and their father Hugh in their more adult years after a particular night at Hill House that finally drove them away.  It shows in great detail the descent into madness of Olivia (Hugh's wife and the children's mother) and Hugh's steadfastness or more rather his disassociation to events that occurred at Hill House.  Time is spent showing each of the children's experiences with the house, both good and bad. 

The story itself is one of incredible sadness and of death (well, of course there's death, it's a paranormal movie after all...), but moreso how each member's experiences were interconnected with each other, and how overall in order to survive, it was necessary to face each person's pockmarked past and right old wrongs.  Far from being a sterotypical ""finished business"" ghost story, this was deeper and more intense.  Throughout the episodes, you can see how each member's experience was crafted by the interactions at Hill House, even after the father and the children were able to escape.  

Each episode is well compartmentalized, with just enough cliffhanger to send you running to the ""Next Episode"" button.  It is not an action movie, but each episode keeps the storyline advancing with a good pace.  It's more of a slow burn psychological horror than a horror story that relies on gore and jump scares.  There's lot of things in the background that you may not notice the first time, but when the movie calls you out on it, you'll want to scroll back and see what you missed.  There's a lot of subtle things in the details that you'll want to watch out for.  

If I had a rational scale for rating this movie series any more specific over ""I liked it"", ""I hated it"", ""I changed the show"", I'd say I give this an 8 out of 10 on the horror flick.  Comparatively, the ""Legend of Hell House"" was a 9/10 on the same relative scale.  It's hard to write a review without spoilers, especially for a horror flick, as there's lots of things I could discuss but that would result in spoilers, if not for the episode then for the overall story arc. 

Good:  
\- Slow burn psychological horror with a good long term story line.  
\- Story doesn't rely on bland tricks.  Jumpscares (rare) are well executed.  
\- The concurrency of the stories plays off well and allows you to see several incidents from each person's view.  
\- The story doesn't expressly rely on trope, but instead allows the environment to set the scene, Excellent use of audio cues and visual markers to instill various emotions in scenes.

Bad:  
\- Acting is flat sometimes, but they nail it on the important parts.  
\- The plot can be hard to track sometimes, especially in the first three or four episodes.  
\- If you're expecting an action packed ending of triumph, you won't get it but the story does bring closure to the various timelines.

Ugly:  
\- Be prepared to skip through a few scenes in the second show if you are a cat lover.  Don't worry, only a tiny bit of gore at the end, but largely just sadness.","Short Review (no spoilers) of ""The Haunting of Hill House"""

netflix,"Hi everyone,

My partner's Dad is in hospital and we decided to put Netflix on an old Samsung tablet for him. As the hospital has no WiFi and the tablet has no data connection we thought we could just download content onto the SD card in the tablet (by changing the download destination settings in the app). This all went well until I tried to open the app with no data connection. It just says ""Sorry, we could not reach the Netflix service. Please try again later. (-4)""

The only option is 'OK' which closes the app. It doesn't give the option to access the content that has already been downloaded.

I tried contacting Netflix but they haven't been able to resolve the issue. I tried signing out then in, and clearing the cache and data but I still have the same error.

It might be because it's an older tablet but why have the download function if it doesn't work when the device isn't connected to the Internet?

Can anyone help? We are hoping to drop the tablet by hospital before lock down begins on Thursday! (in the UK here)

netflix,"It came out like 3 weeks ago and yet I didn’t know it existed until 2 days ago- in which I then proceeded to binge watch it.- Netflix usually shoves new shows in my face with emails, notifications, and constant previews on the home page but this got nothing...? 

Anyways, it’s just another high school drama but..
*The cast is actually diverse in a way that ISN’T completely forced in order to please audiences.
*It doesn’t rely on aesthetics to prop up the show- but still has one (mostly due to the camera work imo)
*The plots and characters are compelling enough imo.
*The acting’s good (imo), despite most of the actors not having worked on a lot of projects before.
*It’s actually realistic (but only up to a certain point  ofc, things will always become exaggerated in tv to entertain audiences). I don’t know the extent to how true this statement is for others because everyone has different high school experiences.

(There are probably more things but I can’t think of them atm)

I’m 99% sure that it will get cancelled after the first season due to its low reception and controversy revolving around the producers, which is annoying ofc -but there are so many other shows to watch so I’ll get over it. Idk how many people this post will reach but I’m just curious about how many people on this sub have even heard about it.

netflix,"I just finished watching the Queen's Gambit and absolutely loved it. But there is a detail that never quite sat right with me and I wonder if anyone else has written about or explored this idea.

The car accident that Beth survives doesn't make any sense. She was in the back seat of the car. in the 1950s. She is wearing no discernable seat belt... Maybe she had a two-point seat belt, as if that would do anything to protect her. She was in a head-on collision with another vehicle travelling in the opposite direction that immediately killed the mother. In the only image of the accident that the series shows, Beth is seen in the foreground in front of the wrecked vehicles WITHOUT A SINGLE SCRATCH ON HER. From that moment on it is taken for granted that this accident is the true cause of her mother's death and the reason for her being orphaned.

This show isn't about superheroes with magical powers. It is about a chess prodigy leaving in a plausible alternative universe where instead of Bobby Fischer taking on the Soviets in chess it is a young redheaded orphan girl. The psychological tone of the story is so well realized that I can't help but think that the unbelievability of Beth surviving the car accident ISN'T lazy writing. I think that the story of her mother's death is one that Beth made up to quell her own feelings of abandonment. It is another layer to the story that speaks to the reality (or lack thereof) of the events depicted in the series. After all, the POV for the series is Beth Harmon's. I don't think this means that every event in the show as a whole is necessarily unreliable as it is in The Joker starring Joaquin Phoenix. But I do think that it is meaningful that the accident itself is never depicted on the show. We the audience never see the two cars collide with one another. And in storytelling, if you don't see something, then you can't know exactly what happened.

Maybe her mother did die in the accident. Maybe Beth tells herself, and even believes, that she was in the car. But there is NO WAY that Beth actually survived the car accident as it is described on the show.

I have all the necessary equipment and it's all set up correctly, as I can get 5.1 from other sources. Is there a Netflix setting that I'm missing?

netflix,"Has anyone else had it happen where you click to play the next episode in a series you are watching from the ""Continue Watching"" line, only for it to play an episode you already finished? This has happened to me primarily on my Android 10 app. When I go to view the episode list for some reason some episodes will have the red completion bar toward the end of the episode where I either stopped play or hit the ""Next Episode"" popup, but some episodes have no bar at all, as if they were never watched. And it seems Netflix just defaults to playing whichever is the first sequential episode that has not been watched, even if it is one of those episodes that *has* been watched, but lost the red progress bar.

Am I doing something wrong on my end or is this a Netflix error? I never let the credits finish on any movie or show I watch so I don't think it's an issue of the red progress bar reaching the end of the episode and resetting. Something is tricking Netflix into thinking that I never watched the episode to begin wtih.

netflix,"This is only my opinion and I don't want to spoil anything, but, the Netflix Horror Movie ""His House"" is a fantastic film. 

Don't be put off by the description on Netflix, it really doesnt do it justice and just makes it sound like a typical haunted house flick. 

Don't get me wrong, it's a horror movie at its core, plenty of jumps and haunting imagery that left an impression on me, an impression I'm sure will come back when i turn the lights out, but there is also real life horrors and an emotional and hard hitting plot line that unfolds beneath the story of the haunted house. 

Excellent performances, fantastic special effects, good sounds and music, overall tone and pacing is great too. 

I cannot recommend this film enough.

(Worth noting: I'm not a hardcore horror fan by any stretch so the typical supernatural and jumpy horror of this film may not hit as hard with those that are, the real life horror elements might though)",Netflix film: His House is fantastic.

netflix,"Did anyone else notice that Blood of Zeus’s core concept feels very similar to Immortals?

I always liked the movie Immortals, and other Greek stories, so when I started watching Blood of Zeus, the concept felt VERY similar.

The mother is killed by an evil force and the young man goes on a revenge path.

Normally I would pass it off as coincidence, but the fact that the stories have so many similarities is a little suspect. Epirus bow = blue sword, the gods fight over when to save the mortals (which to be fair is in every Greek epic), the fact that after the main characters mom is killed he is taken captive.

netflix,"Spoilers ahead so beware. 

After watching the entire show in one sitting, the ending was pretty brutal on my emotions as was expected. As a gay man, watching two women fall in love with each other made me feel so happy, but watching Dani wrestle for her body and mind was tragic.

The timeframe of when they were together coincides with the timeframe of the LGBT community’s darkest years when people were dying at the highest rate from HIV/AIDS.

Being diagnosed with HIV was a death sentence. It has a mortality rate of 100% if left untreated, and at the time the US government was denying the existence of any virus whatsoever so treatments were nonexistent. It was easy for them to deny. The only people it was killing were gay people and no one cared for them. Those infected knew that the virus would eventually take them as it has taken so many before. It was impossible to be gay and not have friends or loved ones who have died from it. 

The virus would eat you alive from the inside out until you’re left with mostly nothing. It was such a brutal death that even doctors and nurses were afraid to treat anyone with it. To me, Dani’s possession is a powerful metaphor for this. That despite so many people being handed this death sentence, they still tried to live the rest of their lives as fully as they could. They fell in love, they fought, but eventually they couldn’t fight anymore. The brutal reality that sometimes love just isn’t enough to save the one you love. Eventually that unseeable death would come for them.

Maybe I’m reading too into it, but it was the harsh reality for LGBT people at the time. It’s a part of history that goes relatively ignored outside of our circles, but it’s a tragic one nonetheless and there’s much to learn from it.",Haunting of Bly Manor metaphor [SPOILERS]

There's a scene in the series with Tabu, one of the best actresses of India starts laughing when her consort arrives and  interrogates about whether there's another man in her life. The way she laughs is so ridiculously fake, my eyes started rolling automatically. It is supposed to be pivotal point but ends up being a total puke point. Absolute worst scene in the series.

Whereas there are so many characters in the story, and it each one has their own intricate narrative, it is totally lost here. The only saving grace is Meenakshi, the playful, care-free daughter in law who's having a secret affair and doesn't give a damn about what anyone thinks. I think I watched only for her, she was delightful. 

You can watch it if you want to learn how not to make an utterly crappy series out of a classic. But meh, rather sleep.","Mira Nair's ""A Suitable Boy"" sucks monumentally. Let's admit it."

She cries and says, “You mean it today, which makes it harder when you don’t.” This quote is literally the exact same quote and idea used in The Prestige (which I won’t spoil because it’s amazing).

Around 15 minutes in, while Lucy recites the poem, we get a shot outside of the car and we can't hear Lucy for a few seconds, then we go back in the car to hear the rest of the poem. 

Towards the end of their visit, Jakes father hugs Lucy and she starts crying. Was jake abused by his parents? He clearly holds resentment towards them, during the meeting scene he just shook his hand and didn't want his mother to touch him. 

During the last scene with Lucy and Jake in the car Lucy randomly has a black eye for a single shot which dissappears in the next one. Was he imaging a scenario in which he was abusive towards her because of all the self hatred, even in his fantasy he had to be a bad person? The briefness of it was odd though.

netflix,"Hey all!

I just thought I would bring to everyone's attention to a new Netflix original anime- style television show that has caught my eye. It is called ""Blood Of Zeus"" and it is beautifully animated and incredibly written. 

The plot goes as follows: ""Chronicles the illegitimate son of Zeus, a young man tasked with saving heaven and earth despite the interference of a vengeful goddess and her monstrous forces.""

The show used to go by the name of ""Gods&amp;Heroes"". If you like Greek Mythology, then this show was made for you. It has all the main key players of Greek Mythology in their respective elements. A lot of power and mysticism, mythical creatures and war.

Be wary tho it does contain some violence for those who are squeamish when it comes to that, because this anime has a lot of gruesome killings in it, so it is not for the faint of heart, but the plot is really good and the story sucks you in, so if you can get passed the dark parts, then you are in for a treat.
It's in the fantasy, action and adventure Genre.

This anime is only in season 1 of this original series for Netflix and it already has me on the edges of all of my seats. As far as Greek Mythology animes go this is the best one I've seen yet. I really hope that they make more than 1 season because I believe it is truly worth more than just 1.
Man against man. God against god. Demons. Oracles. It's worth every minute.

So grab a comfy blanket, pop you some popcorn, grab some other drinks and snacks and prepare yourself because this show is binge worthy.

I highly recommend watching it. And let me know below in the comments what you guys thought of it. K.",New Animation Show on Netflix

netflix,"TL:DR If you are having this issue, the only real fix at the moment is to go to  [https://www.netflix.com/MyListOrder](https://www.netflix.com/MyListOrder) and switch it from Manual Ordering to Netflix Suggests and back again, or just leave it on Netflix Suggests.  Switching it back and forth will temporarily fix the ""Titles not getting added to the start"" issue, but it will eventually revert.  If I had to guess, because this is an optional function that most people don't know about or how to even find, Netflix may never fix it.  If you decide to stick with Netflix Suggests and you want to update a title to the beginning of your My List, simply remove the title and add it again.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

So those not in the know, Netflix has an option of switching the standard My List to a manual ordering list.  This option was more common place awhile back, but has seemingly gone to the way side.  The Manual Ordering was pretty great once upon a time, where you could have a literal list of your titles and manually move them around as you see fit.  See here: [https://i.imgur.com/tZjiHSW.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/tZjiHSW.jpg) 

In the above image you can see it is an actual list layout and not a block preview format.  When you highlight a title, by design it's supposed to allow you to drag titles up and down the list to change their order.  You are also supposed to be able to click ""Move to top"" and it will do just that: move a title to the top of your list.

Unfortunately, Netflix's My List in manual order has not been working properly for many for some time now.  For me, except ***maybe*** randomly fixing itself very temporarily at times before going back to being broken, it has been this way for at least a couple years.  In fact, I had forgotten I had switched to manual ordering years ago, so I didn't realize it was this specific thing that was broken.  I then noticed that on my account's other profiles, that they didn't have the issue and that their ""My List"" was at least populating new titles correctly.

After calling Netflix support, they told me that the manual order of lists was not working and currently being worked on, but no time frame as to when it will be fixed.  She had no explanation as to why it had been broken for so long.  I ***wish*** she had told me that it was something involving the Manual Ordering setting specifically, and how to switch it off, which I had honestly forgotten about.  

It was at that point that I had a lightbulb turn on and went and found the setting, tried turning it off and on, and realized that was the culprit.  The My List went back to normal so at least I can keep track of my most recent title additions.  I had honestly stopped using Netflix very much because of this, since any recent titles I had added I would constantly forget about because they weren't easy to see.

So what's broken about it?  

* If you attempt to add a new title to your list, instead if it being added to the top / start where you can see it, it either adds the title to the bottom / end, or randomly down in the middle of your list.  For me it adds the titles 40-50 spots down on my list.  I've read that others it's in the 20-30 range.  This can be remedied by turning off Manual Ordering and turning it back on, or simply keeping it off altogether.
* Attempt to use the manual ordering function by moving titles around will cause the page to refresh and they will wind up right back where they were, or even worse, the titles will end up moving down to the BOTTOM / END of your list where you sometimes can't find them.  The only way to fix that is removing the title and readding it.
* Clicking ""Move to top"" will simply always end up adding the title to the bottom of your list instead of the top.

One constant between both formats is that if you have too many titles on your My List, you can't see them all.  It appears Netflix has a limit as to how many titles you can see.  The only way you can see beyond the bottom of your list is if you delete some titles from the ones visible, and then you'll be able to see additional titles hidden in your My List.

Well, I hope they fix the Manual Ordering one day, because it was a great feature.  Not holding my breath, though.  Just figured I'd post this since not even Netflix support was able to help me with my issue by applying this simple fix.",Netflix My List not working - Titles don't get added to the start / top - Manual Ordering culprit PSA

netflix,"Hi guys,

I'm at my wits' end with my computer. Whenever I try to browse through Netflix, my screens will go black and stay that way for a period of time then come back on.

-Go into control panel&gt;system&gt;display settings
-Select Graphics Settings all the way down at the bottom

netflix,"I would like to start off by saying, even if you don't like or understand the game of chess the story is still worth watching. That's not to say there isn't something for the Chess community as well. They find a great balance. 

I'll start off with what I like about the show:

1. The casting is really solid. Anya Taylor who plays ""Beth"" in the tv show plays this character really well. It's one of those situations where I couldn't see anyone else playing the character. Thomas brodie is also in series as well which threw me off at first. When he first appeared in the show I kept questioning if that was him or not since his character (Benny) wears this ridiculous outfit. But he was also another strong character which you grow to love. There are others I could mention but I don't want to write about the entire cast 

2. Story 
The story is really a rags to riches/ coming of age story. From the start Beth is put into unfortunate circumstances. She's also is different than other kids and doesn't really fit in with people her age.  Overall her story arc is well done. I don't want to say to much or I'll give it away 

3. Messages/undertones
The story really plays into addiction. It's a repeating theme throughout the whole series. It's the good the bad and the ugly of addiction. The way they portray addiction is pretty much how I see it in real life. It become more of a need then a want. So I thought they portrayed it really well. 

Things I didn't like: 
1. It's hard to think of something I don't like about the show because I almost find it flawless. Meaning I could past somethings since the overall series was great. I think it lacks clarity on some issues. With out going into detail one character dies but we never truly figured out how? Which bothers for some reason even though it wasn't important to the story as much 

Overall I'll give it 9.7/10 definitely recommend watching it

In animated children's shows, it is very hard to publicly show gay relationships due to the studios not approving it or international backlash. The importance here is that we introduce kids to these kinds of relationships early on. Proper representation of LGBTQ relationships in these shows help children to understand that these are very real and normal things. It also helps LGBTQ youth validate their feelings when they start expiring same-sex or other LGBTQ attraction. But when you age restrict something like She-RA on Netflix simply because it display homosexuality, it reenforces the idea that there is something inappropriate about LGBTQ romances. It is important for parents of youth to be aware of these injustices. I would like to know your thoughts in the comments and how you feel about this. Thank you!

netflix,"I ask this because Netflix has let a lot of customers disappointed this year with the huge streak of cancellations they've been doing, either because some of their shows don't make a lot of money or don't get a big audience, or due to the Coronavirus, providing uncertainty to production companies that want to return to their labors as usual. Also, for some customers, it feels like Netflix is cancelling more shows than the average Cable TV network, even though it's way less than that.  But what bothers me about the people on reddit, or online forums, is that they think Netflix owes us a lot for canceling their shows, and they have to please us if they want to succeed. We've seen dozens of written articles and videos that have informed us why Netflix cancels their originals when they're not the expected successes, and yet there's a lot of people on the internet who won't shut up about the service is betraying customer's trust by cancelling shows they like, and how they have to finish their shows if they want to earn customers back again. But we need to get some things clear for these discussions:

* Netflix is not a charity company. TV Networks are not a charity company either. They're in all their rights to cancel any series if it's not pulling in their desired amount of audience they need to justify the costs of their shows. If it's a show with great critical reception, and it's also an unconventional show that breaks molds and delivers better content than expected, but it's audience is a very niche group of people that you can count with one hand, it means the show doesn't work for the production company, and they have to cancel it. AS much as Netlfix users coment online about how much they loved The OA and Santa Clarita Diet, if there was little audience watching these shows when they started, and less than that in subsequent seasons, they deserve to be cancelled, much to your dismay. It's the same as if you open a grocery store but the only people buying products in there are 20 every day instead of 200 customers that you expect to see per day. 
* Not all the shows share the same demographics,and this is an important factor for TV production companies. Some shows are exclusively liked by sci-fi nerds, other s by prestige TV fans, others by period pieces lovers, etc. Some shows are able to reach more than one group of audience, and these are the ones the big TV production companies value the most, which is why you see Netflix creating so many shows in the hope they get a big hit, like with Stranger Things and The Witcher, shows capable of pulling in more than one exclusive demographic. We also have  to take into account that depending on the specific demographic, these groups have a set number of fans, but the big companies need a bigger number of people from that demographic to sustain the shows. For example, as much as sci-fi nerds loved The OA, Netflix expected a bigger audience than just 5000 sci-fi nerds from the whole world who watched the first season to justify the expenses on that show.
* The people on reddit or internet forums are pissed off about Netflix targeting critically well received shows for their cancellations, while internet people ask ""why don't they cancel their garbage shows like Another Life, or The Ranch, or Paradise PD? They should know nobody watches that garbage"", but the internet people don't know which audience actually watches these shows enough to keep them alive, and given than these shows pull off more than one target demographic around the world, they're successful by the company's metrics, so they will only be cancelled when necessary. The fact that the garbage shows are kept alive doesn't mean that the company is doing a disservice to its customers, because what you like is not what the average, mainstream audience doesn't like. And this is another thing we have to take into account: The mainstream audience doesn't like complicated shows that take a lot of effort and attention span to understand. They don't like prestige shows that send them to sleep. They like shows that entertain them, regardless of quality. Would you like your grandpa to just watch cool HBO shows just because they're prestige and great TV, even though your grandpa hates these shows?

My question is why online users don't shut up about these posts that overwhelm Reddit and other online forums, despite the plethora of clarifications and information provided? The discussions about users hating Netflix cancellations should dissapear by now, or maybe the online forum people should do a strike against Netflix cancellations in whichever way they want. With a strike maybe the company reconsiders the idea of reviving some shows, and even then the company will not do what you want because they will still care about what's profitable.","In light of the recent Netflix cancellations, should Netflix obey what customers want to be considered a valuable streaming service?"

netflix," 

Usa  culture is not only very big, it's also very influential,  so a usa  show that points out the differences with a european culture (that is  not english), is interesting to say the least.

Now  , why is a belgium pov going to teach you more about the cultural  differences. Well  belgium is a small country between the netherlands  and france and consists of two major parts, a dutch speaking part, and a  french speaking part.

Now dutch  speaking people from the netherlands, as you may already know, are very  good in english, and by that have  a lot of affinity with usa culture.  However, dutch speaking belgians  speak a bit of french as well, and  also have affinity with french culture.

So dutch speaking belgians, can see the differences in french/usa culture from both ways.

About  the show,  I'm glad the show wasn't scared to adress the differences  when it comes to sex and sexuality (or is it sexism lol), and still keep  it light.

Still I  understand why  the french are a bit upset, the  french aren't womenizers and they  aren't mean either,  it might look that way because the way they are  culturally , but they are very friendly people, let me  explain.

When I go to the north  (towards the netherlands) we go down straight to business. If I go south  (towards france) everything is different. and this cultural change goes  quite quickly, I'm talking about a range of 40-60 miles.

In  france it's still important how  good my work is, but what is also very important is how I deal with them. The french have a word for it , la  gentillesse, which means kindness, gentleness, or friendliness.

See  I can go fuck up a job in france and the french won't even care as long  as I am gentille (friendly). When you are a technician that needs to  fix something in france, they'l give you food and drinks.They'll kiss  you too, even if you fucked up what you came to do there.

Still, if you don't participate in that gentilesse, the french seem mean, and they are, because to them, you are the mean one.

so what do you think happens in a culture where being friendly is so important, of course, love comes much easier.

The  french work to live, that has some truth to it l  I suppose, , we have a  saying in belgium about people who live a life of leisure, we say ' he  lives like god in france'.",Emily in paris and how a belgium pov can give you a better insight in cultural differences.

Mildred ratchets character can't be pinned down, it's like watching someone with multiple personalities do meth.  

EVERYTHING and I mean EVERYTHING just magically seems to go her way. The social interactions in which she tries to take control of people or situations is completely   ludicrous, especially for a woman in the 50's.

At multiple points throughout the series i found myself wondering what was the point of 5 minute + scenes of side character mental patient's screaming when it did nothing at all for the plot. It seemed like it was mostly just filler due to the lack of an actual descent story. 

around the fourth episode it was so bad i turned it off because i was mad at myself for wasting my time watching it. but like a moth headed for the flames I had to turn it back on just to finish the train wreck of acting and writing that this show is.

I think the alienation and isolation that du Maurier crafted for the new Mrs. de Winter throughout the book are incredibly masterful, and her narrative is full of rich symbolism and subtle characterization that drives forward her plot. The suspense and agony that I, as the reader, felt throughout the book has landed this book at the top of my all time favorite list so I was excited to see that a new adaptation had been announced, if not a little skeptical, because I thought the the plot would serve a film well. 

I have just given up on the film after fast forwarding through most of the scenes in Monte Carlo and the initial scenes at Manderley. I feel as though 1. There are so many details that are either missing or changed that have really altered the tone of the movie and the depths of the characters and 2. So far, the characterization of Maxim and Mrs. de Winter have been flat and lifeless as well as particularly dissimilar to their characters in the novel. Gone is the mysterious angst of Maxim and the naive innocence of Mrs. de Winter has been portrayed as fear of all things. 

That being said, I’m wondering if other fans of the novel have watched the film and what your impressions are? Should I give it another shot? Does the adaptation start to feel more like the book as time passes?",Thoughts on Rebecca?

Anyways, I started cuddling and watching a few streaming services with a friend. We watched the Terminator last night, and it turned out that it was both their first movie from the 80's movie, and their first time seeing practical effects. We're both big fans of the supernatural, so I wanna show them more.

Here's what we've watched so far:

The Terminator

Underworld

Here's some other movies I know that I wanna show them:

Blade 1 and 2(yeah, if it's a few years before or after 80's and 90's, it's fine)

Batman And Batman Returns

Ultraviolet

Star Wars 4-6

Interview With The Vampire

Rocky 1 and 2(yeah, it doesn't HAVE to be supernatural, but it needs to be either supernatural or an action movie)

Demolition Man

Akira(yep, anime is VERY GOOD)

Back to the Future Trilogy

Mad Max Trilogy

Total Recall

Ghost in the Shell

So, which of these are on Hulu, and what else do you recommend? Please also let me know if it's got practical effects as well.

netflix,"I just started watching the show and I like it for the most part because I am learning more about the people he has as guests that I didn't know before. But there are a couple of things that are hard for me to get over in order to continue watching the show. 

\- How out of touch he is with technology and how much society has changed. He keeps asking basic questions that the younger audience already understands which I feel like we the audience are then deprived of more intriguing questions because of it. He keeps playing the ""I'm old"" card and it just doesn't work, especially when something like social media is a big part of someone's life and brand such as with Kim Kardashian.

\-How much he rambles when asking questions and how it isn't often clear what he is asking. Then he has to repeat himself in a different way. It's annoying to constantly watch him fumble over what he is trying to say and really brings to light how out of touch he is with certain topics.

\- Lastly, it really bothers me that he is constantly interrupting the guest when they are trying to answer him. He keeps interrupting with side stories of his own and it makes the show feel more like a conversation between his guest and a grandpa that says ""back in my day...""

Idk. It's just annoying to see interviews go like this when there are so many other great talk show hosts/ interviewers who are already doing a great job. People that at least have a basic knowledge of how society is today along with allowing the guest to speak like they are supposed to.  

In no way am I degrading Letterman and his past work, but I do feel like his time of doing on-air interviews are sort of over. He can't keep up with how fast things are changing which is extremely necessary in this day and age in order to have good and meaningful interviews with the younger generations of today.

That, to me, seems to be the most pressing issue the inhabitants face, not the cook's dead mom or the budding lesbian romance. By far the scariest part of the show was where she showed up and killed Peter, and then the next episode barely references her at all.

I mean, what? Am I crazy, or does the faceless zombie woman deserve a bit more attention in the script than the ""You are the father!"" plot point?

netflix,"“Away” presents itself as a realistic space show, however... any casual viewers should be deadly aware of the following inaccuracies and issues with it:

- The crew has severe trust issues. Any such issues with real astronauts would be identified and ironed out during years of prior training
- For the first half of the journey, the crew uses video chats to talk with their families back on Earth with NO signal delay. Transmission is instant across the vast distances, ignoring the fundamental limit at which radio waves (and light) can travel 
- A crew member who has never been to space is going straight to Mars. Doesn’t even have his astronaut wings. He starts off as a liability
- The space suits (EMUs) do not have cameras on them, which are essential for ground control to see exactly what’s going on
- EVA suits do not carry means of emergency propulsion, despite the low manoeuvrability of the external hull
- The crew members frequently ARGUE with ground control... more so with each other.... they all have poor chemistry. The ship becomes a toxic workplace, which is fatal for any long duration mission  
- The crew cannot speak Russian, only the Russian astronaut can. The two official languages in space are Russian and English, ALL astronauts must know them 
- The ship is poorly designed so that if even a single solar arrays fails... the mission is doomed to run out of electricity 
- The crew starts experiencing the adverse effects of being in microgravity far sooner and with more intensity than real astronauts. Even though they spend most of their time under centripetal motion and can experience some gravity
- They rarely go into technical detail on how on-board systems go wrong. This makes the plot more convenient, but less believable 
- They are reliant on supplies launched separately for when they get to Mars. These should have been sent and established autonomously PRIOR to the beginning of the mission. Not when they’re almost there and things can go wrong. “They couldn’t leave it in the dust and storms” is not a valid excuse. Rovers and their delicate samples survive on Mars for DECADES through “dust and storms.”
- They risk drilling a hole from the inside of the ship to get to the water stored in the hull. Even though there is shown to be a valve for this on the outside. The fact that there is no internal valve for emergencies... eludes me

As I said, the show aims to portray itself as realistic. I understand that they have to introduce problems to the narrative to make it interesting... but they’ve sacrificed extortionate amounts of said realism to do so. The movie Gravity, is still the worst offender of this by comparison. The writers punched too far above their weight with this one

netflix,"I have just finished watching ""The Haunting Of Bly Manor"" and I have watched ""The Haunting Of Hill House"" twice - first when it came out, and again later, because I thought it was so damn good.

I am by no means dictating which one you should think is better; I just want to communicate some of my thoughts comparing the two, and explain why I prefer Hill House.

In no particular order, I'll briefly talk about some of the main factors.

**Characters**

Bly Manor has some great characters. Dani and Hannah seem initially to have very interesting stories, with the bright-eye ghost in the mirror, and Hannah's strange discombobulation at the beginning of all her scenes (also, as a side note, the fact that she was dead wasn't particularly a twist - maybe it wasn't meant to be, but it was kind of obvious early on - at least, me and my family guessed early on). The kids are kind of creepy and make for good scenes/creepiness. In fact, all of the characters are good, and really well-acted.

However I think that these characters don't go together as well as in Hill House. They are all kind of individual and their personal stories are given much less attention, I thought. The thing with Dani's fiance is promptly solved after a few episodes, and Henry's story, for example, I thought was rushed over somewhat, and the whole thing with his two personalities didn't reappear after one episode focused on him.

When I watched Hill House, I got the feeling that I knew all of the characters really well. Maybe it was that, although each character had an episode dedicated to him/her, there was still attention given in other characters' episodes. All of their personalities were fully explored and the continuity felt therefore stronger to me. Also, the fact that the characters were related created more close-knit, intimate relationships and higher stakes.

**Spookiness**

Bly Manor's ghosts are also decent. The doll-face ghost(s) are creepy to look at but I think that the effect wears off after seeing them so much. There aren't really any more; just background ghosts such as the plague doctor and the soldier(?) who existed only as a consequence of the doll-face ghost. There is also a more noticeable reliance on jumpscares, I think.

In my opinion, Hill House was able to sustain tension and horror more effectively, such as the beginning of episode 1. Also, there were fewer jumpscares and those that were there often created lasting mental images (the dad's face elongating, for example).

**Complexity/Story**

I thought that Bly Manor left a few loose threads, like why the children forgot all the events. It was all tied up too neatly at the end - i.e. there was a happy marriage with all the main characters, concluding everything quickly.

All the features of Hill House came together smoothly. The resolutions were great, including the identity of the Red Room, the ghosts of the past, the intertwining stories. It felt like Bly Manor tried to replicate the latter with the whole dream-hopping thing, but for me, it wasn't as mind-blowing. The revelation of Nellie being bent neck lady was jaw-dropping.

I didn't mind that Bly Manor presents a story that has happened in the past, but the lack of this kind of storytelling in Hill House raised the stakes a little for me, and made things less predictable. Also, how did Jamie know of all of these intricate details and events?

Also, the climactic events in Bly Manor were not as dramatic as in Hill House. The showdown at the lake and the deaths were all glossed over in my opinion. And Henry just sprang back to life at the end? I found that a bit strange - it wasn't because of Dani's sacrifice, because if he was dead, then he would have stayed so - his ghost would have simply ceased to be. In general the through-line of Hill House and its instigating events held more weight for me.

**Emotion** 

Obviously emotional perception is subjective, but I would just like to briefly say that Hill House was a tear-jerker. Although the final episode was quite romantic, it was still really sad, especially that bit where Mr. Dudley carries his wife to the house just as she is dying. And all of the kids have goddamn traumatic pasts.

Bly Manor is quite emotional but the deaths aren't as horrifically tragic or such a punch to the gut.

&amp;#x200B;

So that's basically why I prefer ""The Haunting Of Hill House"" to its cousin. I think that it nails the horror, the emotion and the beauty (the cinematography!!) and Bly Manor does some of these things well, but not with the novel genius of its predecessor. I reiterate: this is my opinion! You are of course completely free to disagree. 

Sorry for the length - there's a lot to talk about :)",Hill House v Bly Manor

netflix,"\*\*Mild spoiler alert\*\* Some of you may already have started the new show on Netflix, Grand High. I started the season last night and was LOVING the show-- I might be in my late 20's but I still love that high school drama!

The reason for my post is that, while the show addresses many NEED-to-be-addressed topics, it gets very real very fast. I became a fan of Joey straight off the bat and loved her relationship with her group of guy friends. She is this strong, independent beautiful character. 

In the third episode, there is a graphic, long rape scene which left me physically ill and reeling. I had to turn the show off, and I have not been able to return to it.

While I thought the show was great originally, I feel that it needs some kind of trigger warning to go with it. I completely understand that this was a strong scene and there is significant meaning behind it. But I'm left pretty destroyed by it and literally cannot move on with my day.

I had never seen it before but I am a fan of some of the actors in the film so I decided to watch it. After watching it holy crap are there a lot of questions left unanswered, but that's not even the half of it. Many scenes and sections served 0 purpose at all and just existed to fill up time.

\- What was the deal with the Natasha Lyonne character hooking up with the fireworks guy? The scene was uncomfortable to watch and didn't get touched on later besides to make another joke about it

\-Why did we care about his retirement papers at all? It was brought up twice much like my last complaint and I believe the joke was just to put the Princess Carolyn character into the film.

\-What was the point of the backup crew to Handsome? He had a team of \~8 detectives working with him who all but one disappear 20 minutes into the movie never to be seen again

The second episode was terribly written though. As someone from a hispanic family, especially as a 1st gen American, we do not talk like this. No latina/o I know interjects their english statements with ""pero"" or starts a sentence in Spanish and ends in English (unless they don't know how to say the word/phrase in Spanish).

The actors were all latino/a. The director is latino. But the writers were all white.  Not one latino/a writer to contribute and say this is not how people actually talk. This dialogue sounded so unnatural and for me it took away from the representation on the screen. If we're actually gonna have real representation why not go for authenticity when writing dialogue even if it will alienate some viewers (even though it shouldn't since subtitles are a thing, or they could have just had the entire conversation be in English since presumably everyone except Uncle Tony was 1st gen.)",Social Distance Anthology- I gotta complain

netflix,"I’m going to be entirely honest... I was not interested in Kipo going in, I thought it’d be weird, but I enjoyed it. I gave it a break in season 1 to finish She Ra (I will never regret that decision by the way) and eventually came back to it. I didn’t enjoy it as much as She Ra until I realized that my brain was just looking for another She Ra... but then I realized something that changed everything. Kipo is not She Ra, only She Ra is She Ra... but Kipo... is something entirely new and engaging.

Now that that’s out of the way, GO WATCH KIPO!! Kipo is one of the best and most unique animated series I’ve ever seen, having sharp animation, enjoyable characters that play off each other perfectly,  a great message about non violence and peace (that actually worked and didn’t distract), And so much more. Kipo on the surface is just another “oh we can all be friends, yay for peace forever.” No! Kipo is a well developed, optimistic but still logical, intelligently written and designed character. She tries to see the best in everyone, thinking that anyone can change for the better, and is always willing to give everyone a chance. A great contrast to the mutants on the surface who have basically been having turf wars for decades. The world is astounding and fleshed out to an insane degree, and the main villain is... no joke... MORE LAYERED THAN ZUKO!! I can’t reveal anything else without openly spoiling it. But here’s a good comparison, this is the How To Train Your Dragon of Dreamworks cartoons. (I know Httyd has multiple shows, but it’s the best analogy I could think of.)","Kipo, and unrecognized masterpiece."

Never mind that, the first two episodes made it seem like something was going to happen but it's been so long into the series and they haven't even introduced a plot?

Hello r/netflix!

Back at the start of September I created [**r/BarbariansonNetflix**](https://www.reddit.com/r/BarbariansonNetflix/), an English subreddit for the German Netflix Original **historical drama** [Barbarians](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9184986/), a show I am really excited about. It will be realised on **October 23, 2020**.    

The **official synopsis** reads:

&gt;*Three people's fates are interwoven in the* ***Battle of the*** ***T******eutoburg Forest in 9 A.D.****, during which* ***Germanic warriors*** *halt the spread of the* ***Roman Empire****.*

As of now the subreddit is very small, but I hope some of you will join, share your thoughts, memes, and fan art and above all have a great time there!

The subreddit also has a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/BarbariansonNfx) where I tweet relevant posts.

netflix,"Let me just say beforehand that Hill House was absolutely flawless to me. Incredible storytelling, excellent writing, stellar cast and directing. It was an intensely emotional and often genuinely stressful ride. 

Bly Manor is a poor attempt at replicating it. 

Honestly ? It's just really bad. Very early on you just know that they have nothing to say, that the show is going nowhere, actually running in circles. It's one of the most redundant and repetitive shows I've ever seen. The pacing is off all the time because it's constantly dragged out, scenes that shouldn't even be in the final cut last for what seems like forever, it's extremely slow and tedious. On top of that, it's very predictable and kind of cliché ? By episode 3/4 you already figured out everything there is to know but they just keep on explaining stuff and revealing stuff that you already know. It's expository as hell and it's really disappointing considering the quality of the writing on the first season. The characters are very one dimensional, some storylines are useless, some episodes are useless too. By the end when it should be at its climax, everything fell flat because I had no emotional ties to any character : they're just not interesting... at all. 

Everything else is great though, which is all the more frustrating. The cast is incredible, the directing and cinematography are great, it's a gorgeous show (albeit very dark, I often barely saw anything on the screen..) with a great score but oh so shallow and devoid of any emotion and substance. 

I'm very, very disappointed. I was skeptical when they announced another season was coming and it seems they proved me right.

All in all, a great series to watch if you're in between shows, want something a little more action packed, want to support indie film developers, or are simply a fan of zombie thrillers, I whole heartedly recommend giving this show a try.

It was a Chinese (Mandarin) tv show regarding death. Each episode was independent of the storyline.

I can only recall the plot of a few episodes. In one of them, there are two girls trying to return a report to a detective or investigator. The investigator is a young male who is browsing online when the girl comes into the precinct and turns in the form. He notices her ankle before she leaves and it turns out he is later killed by her as she runs him over at a specific time. After dying, he wakes up and relives the entire day again. He tries to change the sequence of events to prevent the girl from killing him again, but he is unable to. It turns out that even the girl is aware she’s trapped in the time loop as well.

There’s another episode that revolves around the lives of two children living in an apartment. The young boy is the son of the landlady and the young girl is the daughter of the tenant. The two kids go to school together but one day the girl finds a kitten and wants to adopt the kitten. The boy is against it because his mother forbids animals in her rental complex. It turns out the young girl is abused at home because her mother is some kind of drug addict and happens to overdose herself to death. The young girl uses kitty litter to prevent the smell of the decomposing mother but the smell of death overpowers the entire housing area and the police are called.

Dock and laptop are connected through USB-C, the dock and monitor through HDMI cable. Everything worked without any problems, but then when I started Netflix app, the monitor almost immediately disconnected. I found similar thread on this subreddit, but it wasn't any help, since I tried manipulating with refresh rates of both monitor and laptop screen, as they said in the other post, but it didn't work at all. When I close the Netflix app, the monitor is back up and working perfectly in a few seconds. I've tried launching Netflix through Chrome and Firefox with exactly same results - when I open the Netflix site, the monitor just disconnects. When I close the tab with Netflix (not even the entire browser, just the single tab!), it's working again flawlessly.  
While searching for answers, I found little workaround, with switching the display setting only to use the laptop screen, launching Netflix and then allowing the external monitor to be used too, which works fine, but you need to do it every time you start Netflix, which is really annoying.  


I wasn't able to find any relevant or useful information about this error, apart of this workaround and few mentions about HTCP handshakes as some sort of authentication when using external monitor to which I wasn't able to find any trustworthy info in relation to Netflix.

Hi everybody,

so me and my girlfriend share a Netflix account. Since she is living abroad, we use discord to stream one show to the other so we can watch it together. It worked perfectly for a long time.

Yesterday came a new ""big"" Windows update and besides it giving me trouble with my ""standard audio output"" by changing it and also somehow messing with the steam overlay, it does leave the netflix stream dark for her. She can see subtitles and menues but not the movie.

However if she is streaming to me, all is working fine. I updated my codec and browser, and also tried a different browser but nothing changed.

netflix,"I had a fraudulent Netflix charge on my Citi mastercard in July (I have a Netflix account but it’s paid via iTunes billing). I called Citi, disputed the charge, and got a new card number. A few weeks later, I got another Netflix charge on my card (different amount this time). I called Netflix and they said there was no account associated with either my current or previous card number (how is that possible?). I called Citi, disputed the charge, and got yet another new number. This time, Citi also disabled some MC feature that provides new card number to recurring billing merchants like Netflix.

To my surprise, I got yet another Netflix charge on my 3rd card. Spoke with Netflix agent, who said there’s no Netflix account associated with current or two previous card numbers. How can this be?

I did notice that every Netflix charge shows up on [Citi.com](https://Citi.com) as “[NETFLIX.COM](https://NETFLIX.COM) ... **DIGITAL ACCOUNT NUMBER XXXXXXXXXXXX1234**” (it’s actually not 1234). It suggests Netflix is using some sort of a token or virtual card number associated with my card to bill, rather than my physical card number. So maybe changing my physical card number is having no effect? I’ll call Citi so they can revoke any tokens, virtual card numbers, Apple Pay, Google Pay, or Samsung Pay associated with my card, but how do I get Netflix to stop charging my card? I don’t have the full Digital Account Number ([Citi.com](https://Citi.com) only shows last 4 digits), so it’s impossible to locate the fraudulent Netflix account?","Netflix keeps charging my Citi mastercard, even after changing my card number (twice!)"

netflix,Just as the title says. I get shows that say “new episodes” and yet it is season 2 of 9. It is not new at all and has been on Netflix for years. Why are they claiming it is new.,Why does it say new episodes yet the same season(the only season) has been there for weeks??

netflix,"Jakes is real and Lucy/Ames is who he wants to be, a trans woman.

I'm watching this right now, but I'm getting strong vibes that is what's being portrayed. Anyone else thinking the same?

Lucy/Ames is the woman that Jake really feels like inside. Jake never went through with his desire to transition because of the social stigma of his family and the small town or ""farm"". This is heavily hinted at with &gt;!the picture of picture of Jake from childhood, and the fact that Jake loves musicals. Oh and what about the fact Jake seems to know her thoughts?!&lt;

I'm sure there are plenty of other examples that I could list, but it's late and I just wanted to see if I'm the only person who thinks this is obvious? I guessed this relatively quickly into the film, roughly 20 minutes in.

Right now they are dancing around in the school and I'm just like wtf. I was expecting this to be scarier, but either way it's not bad. Just a little predictable if my interpretation is correct. Also, gotta say that Toni Colette did a great job in my opinion.

Sorry if this has been said already, but I've been googling ""I'm thinking of ending things trans"" and nothing comes up.",I'm thinking of Ending Things (2020) - Story About Trans Person?

netflix,"
I own a 4K hdr tv. I saw google has a bundle of the new chromecast with google tv that offers 6 months free of Netflix. The new chromecast can cast in 4K and hdr. However, the 6 months free of Netflix is the standard HD plan. Not the Netflix 4K hdr plan. Would this eliminate the 4K hdr purpose? Using the Netflix standard HD plan google is offering for free would it play in 4K hdr?

It doesn’t make sense google is selling the new product 4K hdr capable but yet offer the standard HD plan on Netflix.

Would it be better to purchase the new chromecast and add the Netflix 4K hdr plan to get them most out of it?

Or am I missing something?

Thanks!",Video quality

I watched some movie that was on Netflix with my mother. I remembered it being really cool and unique and I can’t seem to find it myself as I don’t remember the title! I do remeber some key things to indentify, I’ll list below:

- the title had to do with animals, something among the lines of “animal name, and the_____”
- it took place in some foreign country or the UK
- the town was a tiny beach town
- I’m not sure when the movie was made but it seemed to take black before 2010
- the main characters were a male and female
- both were extremely EXTREMELY awkward 
- their awkwardness was what made them entertaining 
- there was one scene where the main character was at a friends house, he tried to boot up his computer, the boot took forever as internet was new and once the screen loaded it was porn",NETFLIX Movie identification NEEDED!!!

There's a world outside of your fandom microcosm that you think is so big. 

If show, which costs money to create (like shit load) will either bring in more subscribers or significantly affect current subscriber count if it was dropped then the show stays. Because Netflix is a business and obviously the subscriber count is the currency the care about. 

If a show, again it cost money to make, has no affect on subscriber count whether it is there or not (in any significant way) and it is not bringing in new subscribers, then off it goes.

They say they it’s not worth the investment anymore. Well what about their users investment? They are paying netflix month after month only to not get the full service.

netflix,"I am playing the devil's advocate here for Netflix. I don't think cancelling shows  are necessarily that bad. I understand the frustration, particularly after a few seasons but if the numbers are not there why would Netflix continue with it. Netflix has ways been in the red far as I am aware so they can't keep pumping more money if the show fails to gather audiences. 

At least Netflix starts a lot of shows and tries all types and genres. They don't need to adhere to any cable censor board and follow any corporate formula to green light a show. Also a lot of shows should wrap up earlier before they lose their idenity and just trucks along for steady paycheque IMO. Even though I watched a lot more American shows, I think the british model of shorter or limited series isn't the worse idea.

One thing I agree that most the cancelled shows should have some closure. But sometimes even that can be debatable show to show.

My 3 big disappointments were Altered carbon, Santa Clarita Diet and Glow. But for AC I didn't like S2 and felt it was aimless and without an endgame. Same goes for GLOW. SCD seemed to have an end and I really wish Netflix could have done a bare minimum hour long finale.",Is cancelling shows that bad?

The movie is about a group of friends who live in Bronx , NY who are fighting to save their neighborhood from A cooperation moving in. Specifically their favorite bodega. The cooperation is also happen to be run by vampires. The movie starts off by a lady selling off her nail salon to some strange businessman after  some blonde dude sucks the blood out of them. The movie is sure interested taking horrors of gentrification and white supremacy. The vampires of the movie are a metaphor for these kinds of people.

The fact that for 90% of the show she never leaves her neighbourhood is insane to me. True, it’s one of the most beautiful in the city but for a show with that kind of name I kind of expected them to go a bit further than that. 

I also hate the fact that she has a piss poor attitude, doesn’t bother learning the language at all, tries to make everything bend to her will and her ways.

There were so many dumb and very uncomfortable stuff, like the way the french characters just speak english all the time. It just makes no sense and while I get that it’s supposed to ease the flow of the dialogues, it’s just so weird to me watching 2 french actors playing french characters, casually speaking english with each other for no reason. 
The fact that it’s so sexualized was also very uncomfortable to me : no, not all french men are womanizers ??

Overall I just found it ridiculously bad and was almost ashamed that they had the nerve to produce this in 2020 even if it is kinda entertaining. If it wasn’t for the very endearing and adorable Lily Collins, I don’t think anyone would’ve watched that.",I’m parisian and I watched Emily in Paris...

netflix,"We all know the evil stepmother stereotype. As much as this is a tried-and-true stereotype especially in family filmsn I'm sick of it.

I have a few friends with the opposite - their step-parent has been nothing but supportive to them, compared to their neglectful selfish parent. The step-parent has bene more of a parent to them than their ""real"" biological parents ever have.

Sometimes marriages fail and having children to ""fix it"" never works. Sometimes a certain parent perpetually does bad, like cheat on their partners or side only with their own parents rather than understanding their partner, leading to a divorce. In such cases, I feel like kids shouldn't have their first expectations of a step-parent as a hugely negative one.

I believe I started watching when it was 2 seasons old, binged those, and had to wait for the next two. I enjoyed it throughout, but by midway through the 3rd season really wondered how they'd keep the narrative going.   


I'm really writing this because of the 4th season though, and specifically the last couple of episodes. They were honestly the most contemplative and tear jerking moments I've experienced in a show/movie. I guess I'm not really sure what to say here, as I can't get into specifics due to obviously not wanting to spoil anything. But my god. I'm still feeling it the next day. Last episodes changed it from a 6-7/10 to a legit 10/10 for me.

It's just so full of cliches. And it follows the obvious ""American abroad"" storyline of so many other movies/shows.

The synopsis can be summed up in ""American goes to the old continent to do a thing, but the Europeans are too set in their old dusty ways to listen. American gets sad, then has a brilliant, creative idea that blows everyone away, so everyone loves them now. And, of course, everyone clapped"". But I didn't watch the end of the show so I don't know if everyone claps at the end...

And besides the cliches, it's more like a Disney show with a big budget. I have so many compliments, but I guess most of them are because I might be too European to get it. 

The thing that disappointed me the most was how superficial it is with the language barrier and the main character being an immigrant. There is much more interesting material in being an immigrant than how people are counting their floors. I mean, this show is what an American would think living in a foreign country would be like, probably, I don't know, but it definitely is not even remotely close to what the actual experience is.

I failed to find something like this in the netflix Originals so far. They tend to have a poor, flat storyline with actors so bad at acting and a cast so bad at producing the series, that it Breaks all immersion.

Stranger Things had a good season one but got bland After. It just feels like a stephen king ripoff (Just mix ""It"" with ""The Institute"" and sprinkle some other common fantasy/mystery themes on top. It is okay, but uninspired). Was hyped for the witcher as well, but what is this abomination of a story? Maybe one must have played the games to actually like it. (At least they got a competent actor for geralt)

netflix,"Anyone had a problem like this and if so know the cause and/or solution?

I watch Netflix via a smart PVR and was doing just that less than an hour ago, the device logged in with no problem. A little later, on my PC, I thought I'd do a search for a movie but on the login page my password was deemed incorrect. Once or twice I've had this and blamed Firefox for somehow adding a spurious space or something in the remembered login details, just logging in again got fixed it. Not today, so I did the password reset routine, put in a temp password for that then while still on the a/c page changed it back to the old one - it's a pain to enter a password on the PVR with no keyboard.

Just to check, in a fresh browser session, I tried logging in again but my new/old password was again rejected. Tested login via the PVR, initially that logged in but after a minute or so that got booted to a sign in page. So I did a password reset again and this time left a different password in place. New browser session, tried the login with the password I'd set up just a minute before and it was incorrect. All this being done via email with confirmations from Netflix about new sign ins and password changes coming in. At this point I'm giving up for the night but if anyone knows what the hell's going on here have at it, I'll catch up in the morning.",Password being consistently forgotten

netflix,"In my last post, I had expressed about how I was thrilled by Season 1 of 'American Vandal'. The show demeanor as if it is a true crime documentary which wasn't. Now, I finished watching Season 2 yesterday, and I can't choose which season was better. The two seasons are both engrossing and brilliant by their own voice. 

The character Kevin was humorously so upbeat and brazen that I don't know whether I would say Dylan or him, who between the both was best. They were equally prodigiously eccentric for me. But I liked Kevin more. Oh and of course, Peter and Sam - these two characters were wonderfully great in Season 2 like they were in the previous season - but in Season 1 I think the duo was much more highlighted of their rigorous antics than it was shown in season 2. 

Season 2 illuminated the blind side of social media that most of us drown into believing something that we desperately want something to exist. While it was comical, it did put a social message lucidly. Out of curiosity, I googled to see if season 2 was anyway based on some true story. So no, it isn't. Although, the creators came up with the inspiration of eliciting a dark comedy by watching various true crime documentaries. 

There will be no season 3 which is kind of bummer. But the mockumentary series is worth recommended to watch. It has every punch that one can get glued to so easily. I mean 'American Vandal' is truly a good binge watch worth.",American Vandal' s Season 2 was Amazingly Entertaining!!!

2. **Dark** \- I like deep and complicated stories. At some point I think it was complex just for the sake of being more complex but is enjoyable to me to decipher the puzzle of the serie.
3. **Altered carbon** \- I like when stories happen in a such distant future that make us question our own reality. The 2th season isnt good as the first.
4. **Travellers** \- I wonder how it didnt become huge too because it had a lot of potential. Is shame it was cancelled after 3 seasons.

netflix,"The introduction of this feature earlier this year was not so necessary, but a welcome one that at least lets us figure out which Netflix originals are popular and mostly without waiting too long for the company to release some flimsy numbers to indicate the same. But there are some things that can make us believe that this feature might not be truly accurate to what people are actually watching.

Many times this year we´ve seen news about which shows and movies end up being the most popular, with some of these being awful, schlocky movies like the live-action Avatar The Last Airbender, or that 50 Shades rip-off called 365 Days. Bad movies and TV series being in the Top 10 is what can lead people ot believe that Netflix is using this feature to only sell mediocre content to mainstream audiences, but sometimes they can have some good quality series appearing in a Top 10, like Umbrella Academy. Another one is that the feature only takes into account the content viewed in the Top 10 depending on each country, rather than taking into account which series are popular in the entire world.

I know the narrative of Reddit around Netflix is that they aren´t giving people the exceptional best content people actually want to see and that defies conventional TV, but instead they´re delivering the kind of average content that you´d see on normal cable TV and that most don´t want. And they could think this feature is another step to get more of the latter, but do you feel like the feature is rigged or manipulated exactly for that? Or it could be somehow accurate about if a series is truly popular?",Do you feel like Netflix´s Top 10 Daily feature is rigged or not?

netflix,"Maybe I'm just being dumb, but I switched on Dead Silence on Netflix and noticed they made multiple cuts to the movie. Only reason I caught it is because I've got it on DVD and have seen it before. It's definitely not me having seen the ""uncut"" version and then the ""cut"" version. There never *was* a cut version of the movie to my knowledge.

Do they do this to other movies too? If so, what do they tend to censor, because I have no idea. It just doesn't add up... Especially if you consider the fact they've put out Cuties and 365 days without taking issue with it's content to the degree they believe censorship or cuts are necessary.

It wouldn't be that weird, or even a slight issue at all if they hadn't put out things that could be potentially harmful, while censoring other things that aren't very harmful, if at all. *Child exploitation and sexualisation? That's fine. Let's include all the close up crotch shots of children. Fictional murder being mentioned? Not allowed at all. Cut it. Not on this platform.*",Netflix censoring movies??

With the recent success of Outer Bank among other netflix originals such as Stranger Things that all started with a film crew, writers, directors, and actors who had either no but productions under their belt or little to nothing under their belt but became huge stars over the platform, is Netflix slowly taking a shift toward preference of younger, more inexperienced filmmakers and actors to have a more appeal to the youth and youngish adult demographic (or regular adults who like low profile film and television)?

netflix,,Questionnaire for a Netflix podcast (16-19)
netflix,"So this isn't specific to Netflix, but I think Netflix is perhaps the biggest culprit of this. I hate series that Netflix lists as documentaries which are not actually documentaries. They just take interviews with real people and/or real events, and then just lie through their teeth about what actually happened. Examples of this: *Making a Murderer*, *Fyre*, *Tiger King*. 

I think documentaries are a unique brand of television and film, because they, as opposed to almost all other tv/film media, are meant primarily not to entertain but to educate. So, when a person watches a documentary, they expect to be seeing fact and truth, or at least multiple perspectives about real events. They don't expect to see a story that has been heavily influenced or warped by the bias or desires of the filmmakers. By labeling these sorts of shows as documentaries, I feel like Netflix and other production companies and streaming platforms are actively deceiving their viewers. 

If a show or movie is meant first to entertain, then it shouldn't be labeled as a documentary. I think that's a good rule of thumb. A documentary is almost exclusively meant to educate. Any entertainment it provides is either a. utilitarian, simply as a way to keep viewers engaged; or b. a symptom of the subject matter being itself intrinsically interesting. 

When a show or movie has entertainment as its primary objective, rather than education and reality (or, in some cases when multiple people are saying different things, objective and unbiased presentation of facts); it means the filmmakers are free to (and often do) misrepresent events, timelines, and stories in the pursuit of a more interesting story. I don't see any difference between these types of shows and the murder porn crap that ID puts out.

**Tl;dr:** I think it's dishonest and deceitful for Netflix to label shows such as *Making a Murderer*, *Fyre*, and *Tiger King* as documentaries. I think people expect at most education and at least unbiased presentation from the filmmakers when they see something labeled as a documentary. I think the onus is on Netflix, as a platform for (and often financier of) these shows, to vet anything labeled as a documentary or docu-series.

I know the rules say any suggestions shouldn't be posted here, but I moreso wanted to rant about this. In politics, there's a lot of talk about misinformation campaigns, truth in media, and fake news. I feel like this is closely related. I love documentaries, and it angers me when I see people accept what they see in these types of shows as absolute fact. I get the same feeling of upset when people spout fear mongering crap that they heard on MSNBC or FoxNews. Just as those places aren't actually need just because they say ""news"" in their names, these types of shows aren't actually documentaries just because they call themselves such",I hate drama series that masquerade as documentaries

1. The younger generations are using Discord, not Facebook. Facebook is dying to the younger generation. The skit in the video makes no sense because those kids wouldn't even have a Facebook account.
2. Yes, problems exist with Facebook, but they would happen in any other online forums/community. People will seek out false information that confirms their belief no matter the platform. We've seen people being brainwashed throughout history with traditional media without needing a platform like Facebook.
3. Conspiracy theories are wired differently. Facebook didn't make them that way. These people take pride in being the minority.
4. Adblock
5. Algorithms and Facebook feed copied how society works. They didn't invent anything new. This isn't a facebook problem. It's the problem with society that is magnified by the internet. 
6. Selling data and ads. I still don't get it after watching this documentary. If Facebook knows I get addicted because of a certain trigger and manipulate it, I'm fine with it. Example if Facebook knows I like a certain page and want to see it's update, so they purpose notify me about it. I'm fine with it.

My main problem is watching other people feeds don't make me happy, and that's why I dislike Facebook. It's not productive and really serves no purpose. Everything else feels exaggerated.",Just finished The Social Dilemma and I think it's overrated

netflix,"This is based on a Broadway musical which was in turn adapted from the 1968 comedy of the same name. I watched that original film earlier today and then moved on to this one. Here are my thoughts.

As you probably expected, no, it’s not as good as the original. It’s much more light-hearted and frivolous than the original, which was rather cynical and biting with its humor. This version also features what many would likely consider a happy ending compared to that of the ‘68 movie. There’s nothing wrong with any of that, mind you. But the problems begin with Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick. They’re competent enough, but their singing is meh at best and they don’t hold a candle to Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder.

However, although it’s not as good overall, I did enjoy it. For one thing, this is a musical first and foremost and I thought that (save for the one right before Springtime for Hitler premieres) all the songs were fun and enjoyable to listen to. I also really liked Uma Thurman in here, and her character is given a lot more to do than in the original. In terms of humor, the script actually recycles a great deal from the ‘68 movie with greatly diminishing returns, but when they stop copying the other film and try to write some jokes of their own, it can be decently amusing. It actually elicited a handful of laughs from me, which was nice. Finally, many musicals sport lavish set and costume design, and this one is no exception. It’s quite the feast for the eyes in this regard. Now I leave it to you. What are your thoughts on this adaptation on its own and compared to the other movie and the musical it’s based on?",The Producers (2005) is currently available in the U.S. Here are my thoughts.

netflix,"I stumbled upon this series called American Vandal on recommendation by some user. I instantly got intrigued by it's synopsis and honestly, I thought it was a true crime documentary show. Until after two episodes, I learnt that it's not. The limited series is based on a true story but the show shot, looking like it's realistic, is actually fictatious. But it was awesome in every aspect. Right from the storyline, plot, cinematic scenes, cliffhanger and the characters, it was brilliantly made. What drew me the most was the relevance of real life picture of social media, anxiety, the need for social acceptance, popularity, attention, truth verses lies, as such - the crux of various phases that we all go through. The epiphany of episodes from the beginning till the end was exceptionally encapsulated. 

I can't wait to start with season 2! I read that this show didn't make through for season 3? I can only conclude after watching season 2. Otherwise season 1 alone is a masterpiece.",I Finished Watching Season 1 of American Vandal and it's Too Good to be True!

netflix,"I’m really mixed on this one. As a stand alone series I actually really enjoyed it.

However, I just really don’t like it as a prequel to One who Flew over the Cuckoos Nest. For starters, it felt more like an American Horror Story series then Cuckoos. I really enjoy Paulson, but I do think she seems a bit typecast as the weird occult freaky person.

The thing for me about Nurse Ratched which made her a villain was how real she is. She isn’t a psychotic supervillain, she’s cold and callous because of life. I always imagined her as having a very unremarkable life growing up, and it was her time as a nurse during WW2 that made her uncompromising and cruel, followed by being a cog in the medical institution for decades.

I just think the Nurse Ratched in the series isn’t the same character as the novel. I think it’s way too fantasy horror, and plays too much like American Horror Story. The crazy millionaire murder plot, and the whole brother and orphan situation just isn’t how I personally picture Ratched. By creating this outlandish backstory, it seems almost out of place that she ends up as the head nurse at a dysfunctional and dreary mental institution in Oregon. Ultimately, for me, I don’t think Netflix have been true to the source material. Ratched is a great character because of how real she could be, we all know of or can easily imagine a “battle-axe” personality, and I just don’t think this is true with Netflixs take on the story.

Be cool to know what everyone else thought, especially on Ratched as a character compared to the book.",Ratched - thoughts?

Their problem with hitting this mark is that very few of their series have the actual library to reach this point. The business practices they engage in shut things down enjoying anything but absolutely monumental levels of success to just two seasons. The true shame is that if American Vandal had gotten two or three more season then it totally could have been Netflix's own The Office.

American Vandal is funny, weird, engaging, and enjoyable but it's familiarity in presentation makes it easy to unwind with. It is easy to disengage from but even easier to pick back up. Having American Vandal on in the background while cleaning, cooking, or however it is that we all seem to watch The Office, is actually a really great experience.

My personal take is that it is Stasi written all over it. But this is not why I'm making this post. 

Spoilers: in the context of many underperforming GDR companies and the restructuring that occurred after reunification, resulting in skyrocketing unemployment and a lot of anger, in the 3rd episode a guy named Kurt Hilmann appears... who used to work in the GDR Ministry for Foreign Trade and then for IMES, a weapon-exporting company (mostly AK-47s). This company soon was on the West Germany's and Rohwedder's radar, for its unorthodox practices and money laundering.

Towards the end of the episode, approximately at min. 29 mark, Hilmann tells: ""Where did we sell the weapons? Africa. South America."" and then looks briefly straight at the camera for about 2-3 seconds, with a deep-sharped look that raised my hair on both my arms.

Hey, I want to find what's the top 2 or 3 most worthwhile romcoms. Here's the progress so far:

**First is the goal:** The goal is to find what is the highest rated romcom according to user ratings

This is for romcom across all types of media (youtube, film, tv, theatre, everything else)

&amp;#x200B;

There's a few things I'm interested in finding out:

* What's best romcom of all time (this seems close to figured out based on the link below)
* What's most worthwhile romcom of last 20 years?
* What's most worthwhile romcom of last 10 years?

&amp;#x200B;

**step 1 -** i googled 'best romcoms' just to see if anything helpful would come up

* \* this was the most helpful, but i dont know if all of these are actually romcoms or just romance
* \* [https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/best-romantic-comedies-of-all-time/](https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/best-romantic-comedies-of-all-time/)

&amp;#x200B;

**step 2** \- from a question i asked previously in one of the sites on reddit (dont rememmber which), i looked at the 4 top 'best' voted comments/suggestions

&amp;#x200B;

**step 3** \- I sorted those 3 by user ratings

What's a high rating for film?

* Highly rated = 86 aggregated across all main rating sites (users + critics scores)
   * Examples (looking at my film google sheet): inside out, spirited away, boyhood
* Meh = &lt; 81
   * Examples: dunno i don't add those

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**These are movies, but tv is harder** cos there's not really any user ratings sites for tv. For tv i'd use:

* \* [http://www.showskimmer.com/?t=Married+At+First+Sight+%282014-%29&amp;n=25](http://www.showskimmer.com/?t=Married+At+First+Sight+%282014-%29&amp;n=25)
* \* [https://www.ratingraph.com/tv-shows/married-at-first-sight-ratings-53069/](https://www.ratingraph.com/tv-shows/married-at-first-sight-ratings-53069/)
* \* [https://tvchart.benmiz.com/silicon%20valley](https://tvchart.benmiz.com/silicon%20valley)

but that's only AFTER there are suggestions. I've no idea where these sites get their data from. Prob one of the tv ratings sites I guess

For tv it's a hard search cos I think all of them are lowly rated or something, but am still wondering what's the highest rated one?

&amp;#x200B;

**For tv, msot ppl (like 3..) had recommended ""Love on Spectrum"",** and this is what a users on r/AutisticPride and r/AutisticAdults had to say:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Love on Spectrum *isn't a romcom, it's a documentary series*. Mind you it's a good series, but it's not a romantic comedy (and if people are saying that it is because they were laughing at autistic people in series, then that's a problem).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I am not a fan of parent interviews as shown in Love on Spectrum, because if we are adults who don't need guardians any more, I don't think our parents' perspectives are as important as our own, and don't really merit inclusion.  
&gt;  
&gt;I can understand including perspective of guardians and caregivers if this series was about people with intellectual disabilities, because oftentimes people with intellectual disabilities do have higher support needs than autistic people do, and of course there are people with both disabilities too.  
&gt;  
&gt;If I were being interviewed for a series like Love on Spectrum, I would say that I'm an adult with a college degree and not to air interviews with my parents if they are interviewed at all. My perspective matters more than theirs in this case.

&amp;#x200B;

Film comment

&gt;Of all RomComs to have ever RomCom'd, ""When Harry Met Sally"" is probably ACME, final form of genre at its height. leads are charming and attractive but not unrealistically so. writing is excellent, performances top notch. It has to be observed carefully, though, because it will suffer a bit from Seinfeld syndrome. It is SO well known, SO much part of culture, that aspects of it look cliche' and overdone, but they're cliche and overdone because THIS FILM POPULARIZED THEM. ""I'll have what she's having"" line is so known and parodied and referenced that it's become its own 'thing' now, but let me tell you, when this was new in theater? That line fucking brought house down. It's hard to think of a better modern example of RomCom.  
&gt;  
&gt;But there's an OLDER one. Possibly one of ORIGINAL Romantic Comedies: Much Ado About Nothing by some unknown English dude named Shakespeare. It's blueprint for every modern romcom. Attractive, but VERY clever people dislike one another. They get involved in a zany plot to help two friends hook up. A villain tries to break things up because he's an ass. Misunderstandings and hilarity ensue. attractive clever people realize their hostility toward each other was masking a deep attraction. Revelations ensue. Ever afters become happy. end. There are others as well: Twelfth Night, Midsummer Night's Dream, Taming of Shrew all contain basic structure and a lot of elements of modern Rom Com.  
&gt;  
&gt;Jump forward a bit and you have Jane Austen: Emma Thompson's 'Sense and Sensibility', any number of versions of 'Pride and Predjudice', 'Emma' (including modern adaptations like 'Clueless!) are all worthy to various degrees.  
&gt;  
&gt;Even more modern, early Judd Apatow comedies like 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up are absolutely romantic comedies, just skewed more towards 'dude' direction than usual.

&amp;#x200B;

**I luv this film bot:** [https://www.reddit.com/user/cinephile\_bot/](https://www.reddit.com/user/cinephile_bot/)

* cos what it does is it takes the comments ppl put
* And then it makes/shows a chart with the ratings

Problem is these aren't user ratings, they're critic ratings

&amp;#x200B;

**Last is the goal:** The goal is to find what is the highest rated romcom according to user ratings

This is for romcom across all types of media (youtube, film, tv, theatre, everything else)

There's a few things I'm interested in finding out:

* What's best romcom of all time (this seems close to figured out based on the link above)
* What's most worthwhile romcom of last 20 years?
* What's most worthwhile romcom of last 10 years?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not able to find what's most worthwhile romcom outside of film + tv mainly cos of how hard it'd be to do so (for many  reasons)","Hey, I want to eventually one day find out what's top 2 or 3 most worthwhile romcoms. Progress so far:"
netflix,"Alright, so I just came to this realization as I finished all of the available seasons for The 100 and started looking for new shows.

It seems as if Netflix keeps cancelling a lot of wonderful shows. I understand coronavirus and all, but canceling these shows does nothing but make them lose a lot more revenue. With that and the Cuties situation, I feel like the quality and integrity of Netflix is disappearing a bit. For me, if a show is cancelled/unfinished, I usually can't watch it. The only one I could stomach was The 100 because a) very cool concept that I loved and b) season 7 gets released on Netflix pretty soon.

I've found lots of Netflix seemingly good/interesting shows in the past 40~ minutes and, after googling about them a little bit (just to see if they're actually worth watching), find out they've been cancelled. The Rain, Sabrina the Teenaged Witch, Ozark, Money Heist, and a few others. Looks like I'm gonna have to some real digging tomorrow night. Well, if you have any good and (preferably) finishes Netflix series (I like sci-fi, fantasy, crime, genres like that).

netflix,"I have been watching this show as of late, and while so far it is pretty decent I have to admit that some of the scenes bug me. I understand that some things have to be written in a way to add suspense. But do we really need to sacrifice logic in order to do so?

So shall we discuss the things that we like or h as te about this show?

Ill start. There are 2 specific plot points that bother me. Both dealing with water reclamation.

Ill start with the ep9 spacewalk scene. The plot point is that they have to use static electricity to attract the ice crystals and sort of funnel them to the other person by the door. really! Why is it so needlessly complicated. So much water was wasted in this scene. Why not collect the water at the source? Why use static electricity at all? Why not simply hold the bags in front of the ejection point and collect ALL of the water as it escaped? Nope. They have to create a pretty scene with water ice floating around cmdr green, And add a sense of complexity to the scene.

Secondly. Over a few episodes they are attempting to fix a water reclimation system. I have to say that dealing with space, The more complex something is the more points of failure it has. So to add a water reclimation system with 4000 intricate parts that are ALL unique doesnt make sense and would probably never be engineered into the space craft. Additionally they talk about how renown the back up system is for its flaws and short life. Cmon. We are talking about space. That wouldnt exist on a space craft. They would never willingly add a shitty flawed system to an extremely expensive mission where any small error could result in the complete failure of said mission. Is the writer even consulting any professional about this shit or are they simply winging it?

While I am not really phased from whats on the tv my spouse gets extremly uncomfortable from scenes that display sexual violence or rape. General violence is not a problem at all, but when rape scenes come up I usually just shut down the movie/series and we watch something else because it causes her so much discomfort.

Its really annoying to watch through 2 seasons of a series and suddenly the producers decide that it would be a fun thing to explore sexual violence a bit more. (looking at you ""Dark""...) Why do so many modern series (especially on netflix) have rape scenes in them? Is there no other way anymore to envoke the viewers emotions?

I googled this before but the only thing that came up was a less than helpful tumbler blog and a website (doesthedogdie) that doenst have reviews for shows that we are interested in....

I resorted to looking through the wikipedia article of the plot so that doesnt happen anymore, but obviously that kinda ruins the tension.

netflix,"It's an open secret that most movie and series directors would prefer to shoot their work in one of the classic Cinemascope formats (2.35:1 or 2.39:1) in order to create a more immersive and a visually more evocative imagery and experience.

However, Netflix doesn't allow them to for the simple reasoning that most users watch their content on 16:9 displays therefore with a classic Cinemascope style movie/series, there would be too much black bars.

This is just a dumb reasoning. First of all, people who watch movies and series generally do not care about those black bars (especially nowadays, when most people have giant TVs), so you might as well let creators to actually do what they want and stop compromising their artistic vision. A lot of things only really work well if they get a wide enough frame.

Secondly, a lot of people watch movies and series on their phones and monitors. Phone screens get wider and wider while the PC users adopt to ultrawide screens more and more. Also, it's quite possibly based on recent news that thanks to Samsung's contribution, the new generation of Xbox consoles will support ultrawide aspect ratios (21:9 is roughly the same as the classic Cinemascope aspect ratios). And consoles usually drive the technological evolution of TVs so it's safe to assume that eventually ultrawide TVs will start to hit the market as well.

Therefore forcing creators to this 2:1 aspect ratio which is nothing more than just a nomansland and a compromise between 16:9 and 21:9 (2.35:1 or 2.39:1) instead of being a creator's choice is just dumb.","Dear Netflix! Please, stop forcing filmmakers to use this weird 2:1 aspect ratio."

Noticed the English subtitles worked, but most of the French wouldn’t show, especially where it mattered most. 

I read all y’all’s Reddit’s and no fix.

So I turned off the subtitles in my tv Netflix app, and all the French now shows up with English subtitles, started movie over and I can watch entire movie now, except no English subtitles for the English parts, so not a great fix for Dead /deaf individuals. 

I tried this on my roku tv as well as my Samsung tv, and ps4 apps, this fixed it each time.

netflix,"Hello all,

As title states, I am running Samsung s5e on Android 9. I bought it new about 7 months ago, and netflix came installed on the OS (and as such cannot be uninstalled) Netflix ran without issue until a few months ago after an Android update, but it now says it is no longer supported on the device. 

I contacted Netflix customer service and they basically told me to buy a more up to date tablet. Super helpful. I searched reddit and this is obviously a common issue, but most of them seem to be on older models or rooted devices which would warrant Netflix not supporting them. 

I have tried external install  with .apk file, tried factory reset, contacted Google, Samsung and Netflix all of whom can't give me a straight answer.

Has anyone else had this issue with a relatively newish device or am I destined to not have Netflix until my next upgrade? (Not for another 3 years at least)

netflix,"There are spoilers for the docu-series below

Before I dive into the subject of the title I think that the documentary was well done. I have always marveled at the space shuttle (and space in general) and even being born after this disaster the documentary made it very easy to see everything from that point in time, something TV-movies have not been able to do. It did not over dramatize anything and gave us the straight facts, lots of background on the shuttle program, and especially the seven astronauts from the perspective of family and friends and didn't deify them, but made them out as just regular humans doing their jobs. Some of the facts were unsettling, such as how some of the engineers were still wracked with guilt for not doing more to raise awareness while others that were in NASA management still see nothing wrong with their decisions to clear the *Challenger* for launch on that cold January morning in 1986. I also appreciated that it didn't show the actual explosion until episode 3, it made the series flow better, at least from my perspective.

So to get back to the title subject at hand, in the closing moments of the final episode of the docu-series a series of blurbs closed out the series with some information following the return to flight of *Discovery* in 1988  about pertinent facts on the Morton one stating that ""*For the next 15 years, the space shuttle flew 86 successful mission.*"" and than transitions to ""*On February 1, 2003* Columbia *broke apart during re-entry.*"" ""*All seven crew members were lost.*"" and finally ""*An investigation revealed a similar failure to fix a well-documented issue.*""

This minor overview of the *Columbia* Disaster should be expanded into it's own docu-series to follow up on why the attitudes at NASA had not changed after the loss of seven people due to their own negligence and complaisance which led to seven more lives being lost. And of course going over in similar detail the issues with the foam insulation shedding off  the external tank just as they did with the O-Rings. That it had been documented just like the O-Ring problem, and because nothing happened the issue was, for lack of a better term, ignored until the ""unthinkable"" happened... again.",Challenger: The Final Flight should be followed up by a documentary on the Columbia [SPOILERS]

netflix,"For some reason that I can't figure out My List has gone bananas. When I add a movie or show from any device (MacBook, iPhone, Roku) it is added to a random spot on My List.  2nd, 3rd, 11th.  Always towards the front but random none the less.  If I add multiple things in a row they will not stay in the order I added them. For example, if I add Narcos and then immediately add The Derry Girls, Narcos may be before or after The Derry Girls, and there may even be movies/shows between them.  If I go into My List on my desktop and attempt to manually move movies/shows in order, the page immediately refreshes and the position stays the same. The ""Move to top"" feature places movies at the end of my queue which is the only time they'll actually move - so essentially I can never move whatever is first in My List. I have 167 movies/shows in My List currently. My List is also set to manual order. 

Things I have already tried:

1. Deleting and reinstalling apps for each device
2. Wiping all data from each device, as well as my internet cookies/history
3. Setting My List order to ""Netflix Recommends"" and then back to manual
4. Deleting everything from My List and then re-adding it

So there was a mega thread about cuties.

I watch and listen to Japanese Idol music. It's. It's what the movie should of been. It's young girls, 14-24 is bands. And it's all very sexy.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FWug-mUYts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FWug-mUYts)

So. I don't really think theres anything wrong with cuties as a whole but.... that trailer.

Okay let me start first by saying someone on Bannerlord made a cuties joke. I had no idea what it was. Then later I had netflix on and I saw cuties.

First thing I noticed was it's some muslim chick. Okay. Cool. I start watching the trailer to see what it is. Oh... okay... this young girl looks really.... attractive... wow! Those a tight pants.

The trailer makes all the sex look.... The trailer focus' on how hot the young girls are. And there fucking hot. Hahaha. Holy fuck it's so weird.

Like I don't have a problem saying those girls in cuties are sexy. You know. There's going to be young boys that would like to go out on cute little dates.

BUT WHY IS THE TRAILER FOCUSING ON THEIR ASSES!

Oh. Then I noticed its a French movie.

Doesn't France have a lot of muslims in it? Is the Director just attacking muslims?

And what is with making these young girls look so good.

I mean... The Japanese Idol music has tons of this pedo shit but it doesnt make me feel like a pedo. Because its about the music. And the fun. Not about just... omg... how tight the one girls pants are. And just all the twerking. Hahhahahahahahaahahaha.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zn5TdAmlMc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zn5TdAmlMc)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNPHQ0yrkW8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNPHQ0yrkW8)

I just dont get Cuties. It's not about little girls exploring sexuality. It's about my sexuality as an older man for a little girl. I have not seen the movie. I mean. Why would I watch it? I'd only watch it because the girls in it have such tight asses. God I'm a pervert and that trailer was even to perverty for me.

So do any of you watch Wrestling? This guy Kenny Omega wrestled a 9 year old girl in a promotion called DDT wrestling. It's comedy wrestling that kind of explores sexuality. This was many years ago. But pedos are kind of just.... a common thing. Like Kenny Omega probably isnt a pedo but ummm he wrestled a 9 year old girl in a wrestling promotion that explores sexuality. So does kenny omega want to explore sexuality with a 9 year old girl?

Different topic but wrestling still. Sunny Kiss. Sunny Kiss is a homosexual or something. Whatever. But in the ring when Sunny Kiss gets hit he makes this orgasm sounds. Like ""OHHHHH"" or ""UHHHHH"" like a girl cumming. It's really dumb. And everyone cheers. And he does it in front of kids. Like.... hes making cumming sounds...

I dont get it.

I dont get any of it.

Young girls are sexy okay.

But cuties isnt about young girls being sexy. It's something else.

Cuties goes so far to make those young girls look hot. Why as a director or a producer of a show would you want to do that? If Im making a movie Im gonna make a movie of things I want to see.

It really feels like the people who made this movie just wanted to watch little girls twerk.

Id really like to hear your thoughts on this. Because I watch young girls dance all the time but they dont twerk. Is there a difference?

Oh. Netflix has some black lives matter thing. Im just gonna rant while Im here and say, that shit is so dumb. They aren't black lives, they are just lives.

What the fuck is going on in this world!?

I NEED SEASON 2 of FUCKING WITCHER!!!

Edit: I dont feel Cuties is about the story of sexual pressure on young ladies. I think its just about their asses. The movie does way to good of a job of having these very sexy young tight women do all this twerking and pole-like dancing. ITS FUCKING OBVIOUS ITS JUST TO WATCH. Like. You didnt have them practice all this dancing because you didnt think its hot. Holy fuck what... fuck... hahaahahaha

I should go watch this movie but honestly I think Id have a really hard time. The trailer was so much more about how the girls look sexy then about how they feel sexy. Like. Is the movie going to try to seduce me as an audience member?

Netflix should allow you to create multiple lists or have at least a ""watched"" list where you can put all your watched shows, away from your list.

Netflix should add a feature to review a series/movie so you can at least read a review on the site instead of just having the % that is shown now.

Netflix should add a feature that allows you to exactly define the definition so you just ""lag"" for 5 seconds, or make it buffer while paused instead of watching in shitty 720p on a TV.

Netflix should prioritize in a way foreign shows in a way that they have subtitles in at least English instead of dubbing it in your local language.

Netflix should make it possible to follow (follow and accept) so you can see what your friends are watching and can watch it as well, or just see how far they are.",Netflix Feature Requests

Let me start off by saying that this movie (8.5/10 imho) has some phenomenal acting by a stellar cast including the likes of Bill Skarsgård, Jason Clarke, Robert Pattinson, Sebastian Stan, Tom Holland, Riley Keough, Mia Wasikowska and many more. Seriously, hats off!

I went into this movie thinking nothing much other than some bad people doing some bad things and that would be it. Boy was I wrong.

The story never seems to let off the gas. Bad people doing bad things that result in even worse outcomes is seemingly the idea of the movie, but inbetween the bad deeds is a constantly heartbreaking story about a set of characters whose lives become increasingly intertwined as their paths continue to move forward. The way that the narrarator, who is the same man who wrote the book of which the movie is based, could seemingly calm your nerves inbetween each devilish act (there are plenty to go around) is nothing short of amazing.

I won't spoil the plot but I will give a fair warning. Some scenes in this movie include glimpses/flashes of absolutely brutal imagery. Including, but not limited to, &gt;!a dog seen hung on a wooden cross!&lt; and &gt;!a mans genitals being cut off!&lt; as well as &gt;!a woman bleeding out over the course of 30-60 seconds from a stab wound in her neck.!&lt; You've been warned.",The Devil All The Time (Spoilers)

netflix,"So I came across The Social Dilemma myself a couple of days ago, after browsing Netflix. I have always had an interest in the psychology of online, social media, our relationship with it etc. So I watched it.

The way that the information was broken down and explored was both mind blowing and scary. They talk about things I've always had concerns about but not enough to drive me away completely myself. I have talked about deleting my social media over the past couple of years a few times but never took the plunge.

Let me tell you, I finished that documentary and I deleted absolutely everything. Facebook, Twitter, Insta, everything. I felt so strongly by the time I'd finished, that I was involved in something much more profound than anybody gives credit for, that I didn't want a part in it any longer.

I'll be honest. The constant going on my phone to click on the FB app is a little astounding. It's autonomous and subconscious. I've realised that I was only going on out of habit, not even for a purpose. I wouldn't go on to see what my friends are posting, I would go on because my brain has been trained to just fill time with scrolling.

I wouldn't say I feel 100x better but I know I will. What I feel like at the moment is as though I'm stood outside a house with the curtains shut, my friends are all in there and I'm stood outside curious whats going on inside but not wanting to go in and see. I feel like I've lost all my friends but I know I haven't!? It's crazy. I've kept messenger so people can stay in touch but I've actually only heard from 2 people lol. I didn't announce I was leaving or say anything. I just wanted to leave. My own sister hasn't noticed yet so it just shows that people are actually interested or invested in you and what you share. You're just part of their feed of other endless posts and memes.

Social media isn't actually social at all.

So I'm interested to hear how you guys responded after watching. Its definitely opened my eyes to my behaviour and attitude towards it before. I realise that I actually have *loads* of spare time. I fill a lot of hours with just scrolling and checking things over and over. I know that in the long run it's gonna be so much better for me. The only thing that scares me is that I'm now outside of the norm so whatever does come out of this in the future, it's gonna be like fighting a losing battle because 80% of the world are still addicted. You're seen as odd if you don't have social media.

Anyway, let me know how you guys felt! I'm glad I've done it. I really am.",The Social Dilemma: My Response

So I just watched this movie today with my brother, and I was confused in a few ways. For one, when did Bee decide to be on Coles side? Like when she shows up at the end of the movie and tricks the other villains into dying she is just on Coles side. 

Second, how did his friend just betray him like that? I mean did she really want to be an influencer so bad that she would kill her best friend for it? 

Lastly, when did Cole have sex. It is elaborated in this movie that to be innocent means to be a virgin. I assume that he lost it in that basement with that other girl, but they made it seem like all they did was kiss.

netflix,"Not sure if this is the place to make this gripe, if there is a better place then let me know.  


I bought my first 4K TV in April.  I ordered the Premium Package as an upgrade immediately to check out the TV I just bought.  When I started watching though, the picture was horrible, to the point that even white text that measured 2 inches high on my 59"" screen (RU7100 Samsung) was distorted.    


I checked out Amazon Prime Video and the picture was gorgeous!  Found a show without any film grain to check the clarity and it looked better than anything I've ever seen up to that point.  


I called up Netflix Customer Service 3 times at least, I have recordings, but I think 4 times in all.  Due to a situation with my landlord and his leasing office I automatically record all calls, but sometimes one will not record for whatever reason.  I remember the one lady not really caring, but the other two seemed helpful.  I told them Prime Video looked spectacular.  I told them that it's a new TV so maybe that's it.  I told them I have the TV plugged directly into the modem, that I have a 400mb package, and all of that.  They went through their routine with me, which wasn't long at all but didn't seem to need to be long given the limited menu Netflix has.  They had me do the GET HELP and check my connection option off the menu.  They couldn't fix the problem, all 3 of them.    


Two of these customer service reps told me to get with my cable provider and have them check the line.  I did.  The first one came out and since our entire neighborhood was out as far as internet goes, he couldn't check the line so he had me reschedule.  I recorded this as well!  Suddenlink is the ISP.  The second guy came out a week or two later and found no issues at all.  Whole thing cost me 2x $60 (per visit) even though the first visit was fruitless due to my ISP being out in the neighborhood.    


I get a new 4K TV, a Sony X900H (getting ready for the release of the PS5) and I have the same problem with Netflix, though gorgeous picture for Prime Video.  I call Netflix, lady fixes everything by sending me an email link to my Netflix Profile.  I click on a couple of dispositions and change my connection from LOW to HIGH and things are perfect now.  She can't issue a $30 credit for an issue the other 3-4 reps couldn't fix (could, but didn't), and for them giving me advice that cost me $120 in Cable Guy visits.  


Supervisor hears my story, says he ""completely understands,"" but that they do not give credits for issues like mine.  They don't issue credits for bad experiences with their customer service reps that cost their customers money ($120).  I ask him to validate what he said after he knows I'm recording the call and he will not say again that he understands.  Just keeps repeating that they only give credits for up to 3 months of non-use if you cancel and within the first 7 days of service if you cancel.  He gives me an address to write a letter to Netflix Corporate.  He said his name is Keri, spelled it out for me.  


Have any of you all had good luck with mailing Netflix Corporate.  Is there a better sub to post this story to?  


Is Netflix Customer Service notoriously bad like this?  Google says it is but Google will say whatever you want it to.  If I am the only person here that has had a bad experience then I'll just drop it here and now.  My experience though, costing me money I don't have, makes me want to chase this in hopes the problem doesn't affect anyone else.  


I have recordings if you want them.  It's all right there where anyone, including Netflix, can hear it.

netflix,"A common thing I read in this sub and hear in real life is people asking what to watch because they feel like they've watched everything. I just want to give some tips to help people out. I'm going to start on the home page and get more detailed. If you follow these tips and continuously add stuff to your My List, you should be able to build out your list and always have *something* queued up to watch going forward.

**Home Page**

1. Check the top 10.
2. Check what's trending.
3. Check the random categories they put together for you.

Seems obvious but I just wanted to throw that out there.

**Sections**

1. Check the top 10 in TV Shows. This is different from the top 10 on the home page.
2. Check the top 10 in Movies. This is different from the top 10 on the home page.
3. Check the Latest/Coming Soon sections. Watch trailers, set reminders for upcoming shows, and add stuff to your list that looks even a little interesting. Reminders send you a notification and add programs to your My List with they release.
4. Check the trending for each TV/Movie section (Comedy, Horror, etc.). This is different from the home page and the top level TV/Movie trending lists.

**Within a Show/Movie**

1. If something even looks even *remotely* interesting to you, watch a trailer. If you're still even *a little* interested add it to your My List. The thumbnails for shows and movies change often. Something that catches your eye one day might get overlooked later.
2. Check the more like this section within shows and movies you like.
3. Rate things you've watched! I normally thumbs up things I like, but I rarely thumbs down things I don't like unless I really didn't like it because I want to get recommended as wide a range of programs as possible.

**Use Descriptive Searches**

You can describe what you want to see in search. For example if I type ""african comedy"" I get a bunch of stuff I've never seen before because I'm not african and I don't typically watch african programming. If I type ""car action"" I get a bunch of results that have cars in the thumbnail or have a lot of car scenes (Burn Out, Wheelman, Lost Bullet, etc.). I even typed in ""Sad Dog"" and get 3 Dog programs with the Heartfelt tag on them. Experiment. I think it works best with 2-3 words max, but that's just my experience.

**Use Your List**

If you go through all sections, coming soon, watch trailers, and add stuff to your list that looks interesting your My List should start to fill up. My list got ridiculously large and it took me a while to realize that your list follows you through the genre categories. When you got to Movies, your list will be there but only with movies. If you go to the Horror section of TV Shows your list will be there but only with Horror TV Shows.

**Outside of Netflix**

Typically, once Netflix releases a trailer of a show/movie on youtube you can search for it in the app and add it to your My List. I do this a lot so I don't forget new stuff between when it's announced and when it's released.

I hope this is helpful. This might all be common sense to most of you but most people I know don't use the the My List feature and rarely navigate off the home page.

**TL;DR - Get off the front page and explore. Check the genre sections, set reminders and add stuff to your list that looks interesting. Use descriptive searches to find specific categories of programming.  Once a trailer for a show is released on youtube you can usually add it to your list on netflix the same day.**",Tips for those who think there's nothing to watch.

netflix,"Last  week, on Sept 10, Netflix released its first anime-styled animated  series from Spain called The Idhun Chronices, based on the young-adult  book trilogy Memorias de Idhun, by Laura Gallego, and created by studio  Zeppelin TV, a studio that worked previously on another anime-styled  production called Virtual Hero, based on a comic book series of the same  name by popular Spanish youtuber [ElRubiusOMG](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXazgXDIYyWH-yXLAkcrFxw).

It  might not be a big milestone for Spain, as they've produced animated  content for some time now, but it's kind of a milestone in the sense  that, on the United Stated, we've had to deal with live-action movie  franchises based on young adult novels and comics because live-action is  more popular, instead of turning these big YA novels into animated  series when they have potential for that. So seeing a hispano-american  country step up and do what should've been done in the US a long time  ago. And the production team tried to make the most out of this book  adaptation. And also I think it's a milestone because it's like the 2nd  Netflix animated production that comes from a country with not many  resources to produce animation (the first one being [Legend Quest, or Las Leyendas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_Quest_(2017_TV_series)),  from Mexico). Productions like this come from countries that want to  showcase their talent to the world and demonstrate that even if they  live on a 3rd-world country, they can try big things.

But  being honest, there are reasons that limit the appeal of the series,  and these reasons are also why it's difficult to support this series at  the moment:

1. Back  in August when the trailers for the series where first revealed to the  public, the most notably aspect, and the one that drew the most  criticism, was the Spanish voice acting, which sounded amateur because  its main cast is mostly composed of a couple of live-action actors from  Netflix hit series like Élite and Las Chicas Del Cable, to portray some  of the characters. Much like in some US animated productions, they  committed to the awful practice of casting people inexperienced with  voice acting as a way to boost the popularity of the series, thinking  that the series wouldn't get any attention otherwise. Worse yet, they  did so without consulting the author, who reported that there was a cast  of experienced voice actors already selected for the cast in 2018, but  Netflix changed the cast for the main characters without her consent,  and for the aforementioned reasons. As much as we hate this practice for  animated productions, the Netflix executives that did the practice were  painfully right on one hand. I was tracking the series on Reddit, 4chan  and some forums to see if people on the internet were willing to  discuss the series, and there's barely any online forums willing to  discuss the series. It's almost as if nobody knew about this series, or  as if it was too niche of a product. And if that's with live-action  actors who are inexperienced at voice acting, the series would be  non-existent even while having experienced but lesser known voice  actors, and it's a big shame.
2. The  other factor that plays against it it's that the first season adapted  the first half of the 1st book in the Trilogy (The Resistance) in 5  episodes, and just as in the series, this is the most boring and  info-dumpy part of the book. As far as I've been told, the book hits its  stride later on, but even while having author Laura Gallego as one of  the screenwriters, the series doesn't have much in the way of exciting  and pulse-pounding developments.
3. Also,  in these modern times we're living in, new TV viewers are less willing  to wait for a show to get good later on. They want their shows to be  successful from the very first episode and the very first season, as  this is the point that determines if a series will be a big and popular  success, and if it doesn't succeed here, it's not gonna be popular later  on even with good seasons 2 or 3. So far the series has mixed reviews,  sometimes highlighting the effort put in at least making a convincing  art-style despite the limitations, but criticizing the shallowness of  the characters and limitations of worldbuilding and animation, and the  for the most part amateur voice acting.

I  admit I like the artstyle even if it looks limited, and you need to  check the end credits, which look beautiful. But the series is not an  exciting watch at the moment. I'd like to support the series, but it was  difficult for me to choose to watch the series due to these aspects I  mentioned, and also because I don't want to be the only person  interested on watching the series while everybody else either forgets it  exists, or think the series is not worth watching and drops it on  episode one. I'd like this series to have more than 2 seasons, and it  needs a lot of support for that, but Netflix is mostly relying on  customer's views to support the series. Otherwise, it will be left in  the dirt and it will not encourage lesser-powerful countries to try new  animation productions. So make of that what you can.","The Idhún Chronicles: The kind of animated production we need now, but that it's difficult to support at the moment"

Why does is it seem like every Netflix original series has at least one LGBTQ character (whether it makes sense or not)? If it makes sense to the story, then I can understand it. But, it seems to me that they often shoe-horn in these characters just for the sake of having an LGBTQ character. 

In Sex Education, it made sense because the character was openly gay from the beginning and his character made sense in the over-all plot. His boyfriend and his frenemy also made sense in the over-all context of the story and those individual characters.

I wish that the writers of these Netflix originals would take a good look at Sex Education and see how to write interesting and compelling LGBTQ characters and not make them feel like after thoughts or like they were just in there to be there.",Why does is it seem like every Netflix original series has at least one LGBTQ character ?

netflix," To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Cuties. The sexuality is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of feminism and intersectionality most of the scenes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Amy's wholesome outlook, which is deftly woven into her characterization- her personal philosophy draws heavily from Sandra Harding's literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these scenes, to realise that they're not just uplifting- they say something deep about FEMINISM. As a consequence people who dislike Cuties truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the independence in Amy's existential dance move ""Lift up my shirt and show you my chest,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Sandra Harding's epic Objectivity and Diversity. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Maïmouna Doucouré's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens.

The last post didn't go very well, with a lot of abuse being thrown around, but we're here to try again.

You are free to discuss Cuties in this thread, and this thread only.  This thread will be heavily moderated and here are the groundrules:  


1. No one cares about your politics. You bring that up, you're gone.  
2. Any direct accusation of pedophilia, you're gone. - To clarify, Rule 2 of this post is meant to shield actual users of the site from being accused of being pedophiles.  Example: ""I watched the movie and don't understand what the issue is"" ""OMG YOU'RE A PEDO!""  If you want to rail against Netflix or the filmmakers, have at it.  But, you won't be able to call people on this site pedos.  
3. Spew any unsubstantiated conspiracies, fringe talking point... you're way gone.

**This sub is not run or monitored by Netflix and we will not be dealing with your rage toward them here.**  

If you have issues with them, feel free to contact them via Twitter, Facebook, Customer Service... whatever. But it won't happen in this subreddit. If this thread turns into a shitflinging fight, it'll be pulled down and we'll resume with the permanent banning.

Edit: For those of you that have cried about not being able to discuss the movie... Maybe you should spend time discussing the movie instead of talking about how you can't discuss your feelings in a thread dedicated to discussing your feelings/thoughts, eh?",Cuties Discussion Megathread

Also, the sub was getting brigaded, and people were getting verbally abusive, so I'm assuming that is why other mods were banning a lot of the comments? That's what the notes on them and the links to their comments show.

I haven't seen this particular movie, but when I checked IMDB for the content guide, some of the descriptions were across the line for me personally, and that's not something I would normally view in a non-documentary format.  Netflix did admit they bungled the promotion, which I did see, and that also was over the line for me. I'm not a big believer in censorship, but knowing how much child abuse and trafficking is going on, it's hard to feel impartial solely in the name of ""art."" We don't have any contact with Netflix or duty to defend them, so I think a discussion is warranted.

There's a certain extra layer in their expressions,in the tone of their voice that is off putting.

netflix,"I recently watched Hollywood on Netflix and I just can't get the show out of my head. Not that it was particularly fantastic, but the way that everything went seemed so... wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

The main conflict of the show, racism/homophobia, seemed so unreal. The racism and homophobia felt almost nonexistent compared to the reality of that time period. It was an undertone that I felt throughout the entire show, but especially hit me when the news said that ""Protests almost disappeared as people flocked to the theaters."" I'm sorry, but there is absolutely no way that such a racially progressive film would have protests just ""fade away.""

&amp;#x200B;

 When I first watched it, the whole thing felt extremely tone-deaf. It felt like they just put layers of sugar on history. Not to mention the fact that every minority character got a massive redemption arc and EVERYBODY won. As if the film just cured racism, homophobia, and exploitation in the film industry.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been thinking about it a lot, and settled on a few theories: the show was trying to show what *could* happen if Hollywood cared about people instead of money, or, more likely, the show is a parody of the film industry as a whole. 

&amp;#x200B;

The title of the last episode, ""A Hollywood Ending,"" is what made me think that this show was kind of satire. In that episode, the first black woman, asian woman, and gay man win an oscar, the first homosexual love film is produced, the rapist rights his wrongs, the greedy executive becomes socially progressive, and the closeted executive comes out.

&amp;#x200B;

In the actual 40s that would be honestly impossible. I mean, the KKK was still lynching people in that time period. But this isn't a realistic ending. This is ""A Hollywood Ending."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Is it possible that the show is trying to make some kind of meta-commentary on how Hollywood downplays the harsh realities of racism and homophobia to make more palatable films?

netflix,"Let me preface this by saying im hugely into adult animation. I've subbed to Netflix and Hulu since either was created. I always considered Hulu mandatory because of Fox adult animation. Family Guy, Bob's Burgers, Futurama, the list goes on of amazing Fox-created adult animation programs.

I took notice of Netflix when F is for Family and Big Mouth came along. My brother got me into Paradise PD too, I tried Bojack, just haven't had the attention, but I hear its great. I don't even pay attention to Hulu or Fox anymore. I was big into Adult Swim, South Park, I love adult animation and Netflix finally satisfies that itch.

I saw Hoops was coming out, got super excited, it came out when I didn't have time to watch, so I put it on the back burner. I had time off, started it, I loved it! I looked it up, expecting fandom like Big Mouth or FIFF, nope, none. it has a floppy donkey dick of *15%* on Rotten Tomatoes.

The psychiatrist at the psych ward is cold and unfeeling. He discharged a patient without any follow up for someone who was committed for self harm and without ever identifying what precipitated her attack on her psychiatrist.

&gt; Streaming giant Netflix has announced a new and innovative service that will literally just pump thousands of gallons of septic waste right into your living room. For the low price of $8.99 per month, you can watch as a sewage truck backs up to your house and pipes 2,000 gallons of brown sludge through the wall until you are neck-deep in toxic waste.
&gt; 
&gt; ""The industry is evolving, and we're evolving with it,"" said Reed Hastings, co-CEO and chairman of Netflix. ""We started to realize we were paying people millions of dollars to produce expensive septic waste for the family to enjoy and consume unquestionably. As it turns out, you can get the putrid sludge straight from an underground tank for free! Who would've guessed! This will cut billions of dollars from our expenses and enable us to deliver more sewage to your home than ever before!"" 
&gt; 
&gt; The CEO also said not to read too much into the new service: ""It's not a metaphor or anything. It's just raw, pure, untreated sewage.""
&gt; 
&gt; Enthusiastic Netflix customers have jumped on this new service and are gleefully rolling in their slime-coated living rooms. ""I don't like all the waste,"" said one excited parent. ""But sometimes, it doesn't smell all that bad. Definitely worth the $8.99 per month!"" 
&gt; 
&gt; Starting next year, Netflix will also offer a more premium service that allows you to have your septic waste delivered by a real-life drag queen.

netflix,"The crew prepared months for this dancing tournament, and Amy pushed the 4th girl into the river so she could take her spot.

Then after dancing on the stage, Amy suddenly had a change of heart and left. How could she do that? That not only didn't make sense, but also betrayed her friends' trust, especially the girl with the glasses who defended her all the time. They could have won the competition. Amy ruined it. It was so selfish. 

At the end, it's seen she joined the neighborhood's children play. It's so lame. The movie is supposed to be about rebellion, to be about going against the enforced cultural norm, to be about personal exploration and liberation. That was a set back. And also it was unbelieable and unrealistic, because a girl thirsting for freedom and breaking the chain from the senseless ""traditions"" wouldn't just all of sudden have a change of heart and go back into boring, ""traditional"" life style again.",Cuties's ending is abrupt and kinda disappointing (spoilers)

netflix,"What happened to Netflix's apparent one-time goal of producing nerd pleasing sci-fi with bite? This gripe goes back to them losing The Exapanse to Amazon, becasue the show simply has not been replaced, and they are now axing more sci-fi with potential to be more than shite tween-drama. I just finished watching Altered Carbon season 2, yes it was hard work. I am not surprised they have canceled season 3. Season 2 was a pale shadow of season 1. 

Now the show is canceled I feel that the show creators were way to  cowardly with season 2..it went out with a whimper. No characters with  venom, no sex, no cynicism, lots of violence to try make up for it...it does not - Call of duty is full of violence too, and popular with kids for a reason. The  entire season is plagued by a feeling of what I can only describe as woke censorship and a lack of spine. And boy did season 2 miss James Purefoy's acting and delivery. Never underestimate what having an actor who has actual stage experience can do to drag an entire show up to standard.

Terrible. What a waste  of potential. I dont think netflix have many other interesting IPs (If I'm ignornat of some shows they are doing/have al;ready made, please enlighten me)...

netflix,"i was really looking forward to the show ""Away"" with Hillary Swank as the commander of the first manned mission to mars. I used to work for ESA (european space agency) in the past and know a few things about how the space industry and space missions work - so i was hoping for a fresh and realistic show about humand exploration of space. But the show turned out to be a huge disappointment. Let me list a few things about ""Away"" that bother me:

&amp;#x200B;

1. The crew: Nobody on this ship has any right to be in space at all. they are all self-absorbed, petty, backstabbing mavericks - not team players, who would put the mission above all else. there is zero chance that anyone acting like the people in this show would be put anywhere near a mars mission. we have a cosmonaut hiding his failing eyesight (like that wouldn't be caught in an exam and be immediate grounds for disqualification), a crew member suffering ""space madness"" and sleep walking on the ship (that's ""Armageddon"" level of stupid). most members spend a significant time chatting with their relatives at home - and getting entangled in their BS.  Missions are just not run like that.
2. Ship design: The mars rocket in this show has to be the worst designed ship in the history of space travel.  Start with the solar panels: it needs all three panels to keep the crew alive??? What if a panel gets damaged on the way to mars... on a real mission it would go like this: ""3 panels are great, but we only really need two, and we can manage with one, and even if that loses 75% power we will be fine."" but lets say they DO need all three panels. then the three panels would provide enough power for the ship all the way out to mars. a ship close to earth would get more than twice the energy from its solar panels - so having a deployment failure of one panel would give them easily a few months to figure out a fix. there would be absolutely no reason for a pointless suicide maneuver to get the panel into place. then there is their water reclamation system: they have one main system, and a backup that isn't a backup at all because it doesn't provide enough water for the crew. i cant even...... why have a backup at all then???
3. wasted space: whoever designed this ship has never looked at an image of the ISS interior. on a manned mission to mars you would fill every inch of wall, floor and ceiling with storage, scientific equipment and computer consoles. you would maybe get ONE larger section to hang out in. but separate crew quarters would definitely be impossible and completely unnecessary. those are just an incredible waste of space and weight. just imagine the amount of additional scientific equipment you could bring with you for the weight of one of those crew quarters. astronauts themselves would probably rip out all that stupid feel good comfy furniture and replace it with more equipment themselves! they are not on this flight to have a relaxed ride to mars. on the other hand: the crew in this show would actually better be suited for a Caribbean cruise ship, so that might explain their lavish accommodation.
4. water as radiation shielding: so they are using water inside the hull as radiation shielding. this is a really bad idea. on a spaceship weight is your number one concern. pumping many many tons of water into your ship to shield the crew from radiation would make a trip to mars impossible. water isn't even that good of a radiation shield by weight - you would use thin high density material like lead foil as shielding. i also don't understand why they basically removed radiation as a plot device by shielding the whole spaceship. radiation management could have been a big part of the show's plot - making for a more realistic and ""dangerous"" setting. i'm pretty sure they didn't have any science consultant at hand when writing in the whole water thing in the script.
5. the earth drama: ok, that's the most annoying part of the show. i couldn't care less about the drama on earth. you can for example skip episode 5 entirely - there is nothing happening of note. at all. except for their communication changing from real-time HD video chat to voice mail only with HUGE time delays. which brings me to....
6. communication: many weeks into their journey they still have no time delay in their communication at all. even on the moon you would have more than 2 seconds between you saying something and hearing their response. not on this show - they seem to have instant faster than light communication figured out! again - i don't understand that from a writer's perspective. the growing time delay could have been used as a perfect device to show the increasing distance to earth... also, it is pointed out that com delay would be growing to ""hours"" later in their journey. no - the maximum distance between earth and mars is less than 0.4 light hours. time for a signal round trip is still less than an hour then. but during the journey to mars trajectories would keep the ship much closer to earth (probably within 20 minutes). this is because you launch the ship in the same direction the earth is orbiting the sun and arriving at mars on its close approach to the earth orbit - that's pretty much the only viable orbit.
7. No science: astronauts don't seem to perform any experiments at all during their journey. a mission to mars would be filled with scientific experiments and observations the crew would have to perform. not just to keep them busy, also because it's the first time humans are leaving the earth-moon-system.
8. a few details: their space suits' reflective visors are NOT reflective, just slightly tinted. food is grown in the zero g section of the spaceship (would hamper growth a lot). no fitness training on the ship. etc etc etc

those are just a few things wrong with the show. feel free to add more - because there is plenty of BS going around.","""Away"" is one of the worst sci-fi shows in a long time - and it's a damn shame"

netflix,"So I just suffered through this trainwreck of a movie and it was an incoherent mess. There was no character growth, everyone was petulant and moody, it felt like a first draft script a teenager might come up with and then just ran with it.

You could drive a semi through the plot holes in this movie. In what should have been the climax of the movie the protagonists simply abandon their quest. They just decide not to do the thing they said they were going to do and leave the scene. It's so infuriatingly awful.

Did I mention no character is likable? Everyone is so whiny and stupid you just really can't care if anyone succeeds. But don't worry because there won't be any character growth. Nobody will complete their arch. Everyone's motivations are only consistent to move the characters to the next scene and then it's tabula rasa, their motivations are wiped clean and they won't have learned anything or grown a second dimension.

netflix,"Let me preface this by saying, I am halfway through the show and quite enjoying it, and I will finish it. That being said:

Why is going to mars so important for Emma and Matt that they put their daughter through this immense, 3 year long stress that comes with it? She is risking her life and thereby risking her daughter losing her mother basically forcing Lex live 3 years not knowing if her mother will ever come back from the mission with a 50% survival estimation. And Matt supports that decision. Why must it be Emma going to Mars. Without her they would have found another person to do the job. I just don't understand why she has to go. She's putting her life and thereby the mental well-being of her daughter on the line, for what? The glory of being one of the first people on mars? It seems a bit egoistical to me. It just doesn't seem worth it to risk all of that just to go to Mars.

If we take Interstellar for example, the reason Cooper needs to go is because it's either staying with his daughter or saving humanity, basically (if we accept the fact that they couldn't find anyone else to do his job, which makes enough sense in a world where NASA has been basically shut down). That's a really hard decision but I can understand and admire that he chose humanity over staying with his daughter. But in Away the choice doesn't seem so hard. No one would care if it's Emma or someone else leading the mission, they'll go to mars anyway. So it's a completely personal choice for her to go and she does it simply because she wants to achieve her dream, when there is something way more important on the line, on Earth.

I hope someone reads this who has watched Extraction and has wanted the answer to the only question in the movie that matters. I have rewatched it several times and, yes, obviously Tyler survives and I think they did a very good job of ending it as they thought that if the movie doesnt warrant a sequel at least it would have a top notch 'Nolan-esque' ending......however, that is not the most important question in the movie. The most important question is that in the beginning, Sanju states that Tyler would do it but due to the circumstances surrounding Mahajan Sr, they would not be able to afford him .........the most important question that ties together the entire plot line is .....what is Tyler's price. 

Does he work exclusively for Nik, or does he take international contracts.....as he admitted to doing 'assassinations' and he seems like the kind of guy that can be subtle if he wants. 

I mean - I think there is an entirely different, Bond, side to Tyler that the next movie should explore. His motivations for taking high risk jobs would throw him into the upper echelon of top tier jobs because he doesnt care about the outcome. 

Sanju thinks of Tyler immediately, so does that mean that Tyler is a well known mercenary? How come he doesnt have offers just rolling in ....?

Nik says they hit the jackpot .......they have their price and obviously the warrant for the job has to be higher ......

.......what is Tyler's personal price and what did they offer Nik to make her take the job .....as she seems quite high profile.

I enjoy autoplaying trailers as I can just flip left or right and see what it's about (I have a fast internet so I don't know if people have an issue with loading or just hate it) but what I do miss about Netflix, is many years ago it allowed you to not only rate the shows (proper rating, not a thumbs up or down) which worked quite well with the algorithm but the site allowed you to pick all the genre's you like and dislike and order the accordingly. It allowed you to pick your favourite shows so it would find more like it, while allowing you to ignore stuff you don't like.

netflix,"Spoilers ahead, of course.

Man, as a reader of the book and a general fan of Kaufman I had high expectations for this movie. It starts off promising and many of the scenes in the house were quite interesting with stellar performances from most of the cast (though not really Jake’s actor funnily enough?) but it just gets worse and worse as you try to find answers to the mysteries laid out by the film. Not only is the ending entirely different from the books, it comes off to the viewer as an incoherent mess devoid of any clear direction. I truly feel bad for anyone viewing this narrative for the first time because I would have had absolutely 0 idea what the fuck was even happening. 

Kaufman seems to get more distracted by his surrealist stylisation of the the story rather than actually furthering the plot in a logical or even entertaining fashion. This leads to some cool moments but IMHO he misses the nuance and some core ideas of the text. Most notably, I was particularly confused by the characterisation of Jake. He is completely different in the text both in appearance and personality. Though still strange and perhaps awkward in ways, he appears more charming and the girlfriend has more of a dilemma trying to decide if Jake is actually bad or not whereas in the film it seems that the conversations they have mostly consist of repeated questions and phrases. Instead of fleshing out Jake and hinting at his own insecurities he just comes across as a jumpy, paranoid weirdo that so painfully clearly has something wrong with him from the get go - robbing the viewer of so much of the mystery and tension surrounding him.

netflix,"I'm not one to comment my theories about movies but this one is a must. I just finished the movie and I've watched a couple theory videos to confirm and/or deny my thoughts. Overall, the movie was extremely interesting and I loved unpacking it. I don't think 'split personalities' is a great way of explaining it, though. I could be wrong (I didn't read the book), but my interpretation of it was that Lucy was the idea of 'the one' and 'a one' in Jakes life. Her body was just a surrogate for the women in Jake's romantic life. The janitor is Jake and the movie is Jake recalling his life, decisions, and personal judgements. Yes some parts were a bore, but I think each little detail mentioned had away of coming around and reminding us, subconsciously, that in movies, everything is there for a reason. The mind is often times not a chronological story. Some times you think of random times in your life that don't tie your previous thought and that's okay. There is not one right way of constructing a thought. I loved the little janitor scenes. The randomness of them gave me some stability even though it was the opposite. Idk... I really liked the movie... even though it is one of the most pretentious ones ive seen in a while. This movie is the kind of movie that people will call a 'film' and I don't disagree.

netflix,"If this is the wrong place to post this question, I apologize and I’ll go ahead and delete. But I figured I would ask. So some random person signed into my Netflix account from across the country. I got a email notification from Netflix saying that my number was changed to my own number. I thought that was weird. Then I got another notification right after saying the number had been changed again, but the last two digits in the phone number preview weren’t mine. I think he was trying to change the number the first time, but messed up.

So I immediately logged in and saw where the phone number was changed. I guess this guy was trying to link his phone number to my account. I now know his full number, because the dude listed it, and it’s valid. So I don’t know if that was dumb on his part. I immediately changed my password and signed out of all devices. I checked my most recent activity and saw the unauthorized login and saw two emails from Netflix saying he signed in on his phone and web browser and it matched the device activity. He was just starting to watch a show too. Bummer. But I guess my main concern has to do with my phone number. I’m assuming this person has my number, so I’m thinking it might be a bad idea to verify my phone number to be used for account recovery. I wasn’t sure if you could use your phone number to recover the account, if it will let you bypass the password. So I’m leaving it unverified. I’m also a little worried he might be able to access the account again since he got in the first time. With me changing the password, changing the number back to mine, and signing out of all devices, should that keep this person out for good?",Someone hacked into my account and changed my phone number to their own.

netflix,"My example here is going to be *Lucifer*. I have never seen the show. Don't really have any intention of ever watching it. However, I know quite a bit about it, simply because I have an understanding of the hero's journey and I've seen the trailer for each season. 

For instance, in the latest season, the fact that Lucifer is not actually Lucifer and is Michael, should not be something revealed in the trailer. It's a spoiler. And then, when real Lucifer comes back and they duke it out, I know very well what is going to happen. They battle, Lucifer gets defeated initially, has an epiphany, and defeats Michael. 

Of course I have no clue if any other important characters die, or if this battle doesn't actually end here in season 4, the details elude me, etc. But I should not be able to intuit all of that from seeing the trailer.

Trailers are supposed to bring people in to watch the show/movie, because the trailer gives us a taste of the mystery, and then leaves off on a black screen right before it shows who/what/where.

She wants the world to operate like in her favorite books, games shows - which leads to her second wish...

*I wish real life were like TV.*

TV, where the colors are bright and cartoonish, where animals talk, and where magic is real.  In her mind things are always so much more mysterious and special than they seem to be in real life, where discovering the true realities of things can be both difficult and depressing. On TV she sees a world in her cartoons that match that internal vision.  There, she sees a world which lives up to the promise that adults keep telling her exists.  

But this whole experience has been so incredible, and she doesn't want it to end.  She wants to be able to have fun like this forever.  She would not have the emotional maturity to care about the fact that every human and animal on the planet were now mind trapped in her childish desires, compelled to go along with her games and whims, their bodies torturously disfigured into cartoonish visages of wonder and pain.  The planet transformed from its astronomically formed, geologically sculpted, billion year beauty to a blob of impossible unreality floating obstinately through space.  

It isn't enough, though.  A child given all of their desires will not learn satisfaction, but rather will cultivate newer and more complex yet base desires.  And thus, for her third and final wish...

*I wish I could keep making wishes with all my friends, forever.*

Which gives us the genesis of the Wishing Tree, and the final immortal seal on this tomb of horrors, which will lash its victims with its sisyphean adventures which will begin anew long after the particles which entail the rest of the real universe evaporate into a cold, dead reality.  Would that it were so for the poor souls trapped in the Rainbow Kingdom.",True and the Rainbow Kingdom (Netflix Kids) is a post apocalyptic nightmare hellscape

netflix,"I’ve seen a lot of posts about the house, and how the Watts were having some difficulty with the mortgage. When I look at that house, I think of the marriage. The house was made entirely in Shannan’s image. It was very feminine. A lot of pastel accent colors, those plastic orange plants in the kitchen, and even floral writing on the closet walls. He was pulling in the majority of their income, but that house was not his at all. Chris’ only space was the unfinished basement. 
I think even Agent Tammy Lee mentioned  this in the Feb ‘19 interview.

Clearly house decor should not result in a quadruple homicide, but it always made me think it added to Chris’ feeling that he was not in control of his life. The murders, to me, were about not just rage, but control. Everything in their lives leading up to that morning was Shannan’s idea, and under Shannan’s control. I am not victim blaming, just positing a theory on the motive.

The family (3 children), the marriage, moving to Colorado, the expensive house, the expensive school, the lack of income to pay for all this stuff. I think him snapping had a lot to do with wanting to take back control. Remember, he was a mechanic. Chris was, is, a guy that dealt in real world analytics. He knew their way of life had already become unsustainable. He knew it wasn’t what he wanted. That house speaks volumes.",That house

netflix,"So Netflix is normally really good about audio and subtitles. Depending on where you are in the world there will be a myriad of options for subtitles and audio and it’s easy to switch between any available language. And I’ve NEVER seen a movie that doesn’t have it’s original audio.

But inglorious Basterds in Germany is missing just that. And this wasn’t always the case, by the way. So yeah, this movie that features 4 languages has all the original audio *except* for the English dialog, which is dubbed over in German. Of all the movies you could dub over, this one makes about the least god damn sense. 

For me personally, watching synchronized movies is intolerable and unacceptable, and I’ve never seen Netflix do this for any other movie, let alone a blockbuster Tarantino flick. So I’m really scratching my head about why they got rid of the original language. 

Does it have something to do with the subject matter and it being in Germany? Did they see something inappropriate in the original movie and change it for the German audience? It’s one of my favorite movies and I’m just super annoyed I can’t watch it (on Netflix anymore).",No original audio in Inglorious Basterds in Germany?!

OKAY HEAR ME OUT I JUST HAD THIS IDEA because I was watching a reaction channel on YouTube to a show, but it’s the one channel I’ve seen do almost the whole episode without getting copyrighted. I feel like it feels so comfortable to be able to watch this with someone? Specially with corona and not being able to go out, there’s definitely something about it because channels like this get so many views, but I thought of it like a twitch game, but instead of watching someone play, you watch them react or watch with them. There could be multiple options. Maybe this is already happening on twitch or discord or something, or maybe it’s really not that great of an idea, but it got in my head and I had to share it so that’s it now.

netflix,"Read before downvoting this. It's not a secret that Netflix has a certain agenda. You can be in favor of it or hate it. That's not up for discussing. If you don't like it you can cancel your subscription. I'm not in favor of it, but I can live with it. In the beginning, you had sense8, it was different and a gamechanger because of the characters. If you liked it you watched, otherwise, you skipped. It was a well-liked series and showed the vision and policy of the company. For some reason, it got canceled. After canceling a couple of things started to change. More characters with LGBT backgrounds appeared on the series that we do not see regularly see on the screen. This was not really an issue, it got certain comments and of course, hate messages. It became a bit annoying when it was getting pushed too much into the narrative of popular series. Sometimes it worked and most of the time it just looked acquired and forced, especially in existing series where it was used as a big part of the plot. And every series started to get the same treatment. 

  
 Until this point, I don't have any issues with it. I don't like it, but like I said it's Netflix you either leave it or subscribe. You can enjoy a good story without agreeing to every political message/opinion it tries to push for. But the series Cuties has gone too far. Normally the running joke is on every teen series/movie every teen is played by a forty-year-old. There is a reason for this, you don't sexualize underages actors or don't put them in that position. You just don't. That should be the limit. This should be stopped before it gets out of hand or it gets normalized.","Unpopular Opinion: Netflix is pushing the limit too much.

netflix,"As we all know Netflix got three plans : Basic with SD and one screen at once, Standard with HD and 2 screens and Premium with UHD HDR and 4 screens. 

Of course, the price increases with the number of screens which seems logical since many people use those higher plans with several people, not even necessarily in the same house since they don't control that at all.

But what seems weird to me is that Basic plan? Having a plan for one screen may be logical, many people probably don't share it or are fine with one but that plan is still only SD. Who is watching only SD in 2020?

It also make no sense because that Basic plan is actually the most expensive one if you count per user and yet, it got the worst quality. Does Netflix want people to share subscriptions instead? 

We can also see that most other streaming services aren't working like that and don't have a cheaper plan with less screens and less quality.",Does Netflix having a SD-only plan make sense in 2020?

I end up having to turn off the subtitles entirely whenever I'm watching a dub. I wish they would have an option to have closed captions specific for English dubs.

netflix,"First off, let's all just admit as of today on (31st Aug 2020), barely anyone have seen the movie. It was only released at the Sundance Film Festival and is shown in theatres in France so audience is very limited.

The outrage started 10 days ago over the promotional poster, which is understandably so, but the outrage bandwagon kinda went off the rails with so much misinformation. Claiming its a netflix series, it has sexually explicit scenes which requires the TV-MA rating, it was made for pedophiles, it shouldn't exist, etc. Youtuber hot-takes were all over the place and cuties was a trending topic on r/memes for days. There was even a petition for Netflix to stop the movie from releasing.

So today, the initial outrage has died off and now is mostly just some knee jerk reaction post. There's barely any post on Twitter or reddit about cuties today. Thought it would be a good opportunity to come out with some speculation.

So among all the outrage, there were a few of the more level headed youtubers who gave out a more logical take on the movie.

[https://youtu.be/Cd4UgKViYq4](https://youtu.be/Cd4UgKViYq4)

While the Netflix marketing did give a bad first impression, a bit of googling would have easily cleared some misunderstanding. Netflix did not make this movie, its an acquired movie just like a bunch of other movies they have. It was shown at the Sundance Film Festival with ok to good reception, winning an award and no complaints of sexualizing any of the cast. It was released in French theatres with a G rating, ok to good review and again, no complaints of sexualizing any of the cast.

So, even without watching the movie, I can speculate that a lot of the outrage was kinda false. There's no way an entire country's movie rating board would be ok with it if really has a pedo materials. But we still need to wait for the movie to be out to properly judge it.

So, how do you think its gonna play out come 9 Sept?

First, I think there will be a divide on the internet between the ""have never and will never see this disgusting movie"" crowd and the ones who gave it a chance crowd.

Right now, most of the outrage come from youtube commentators rather than actual movie reviewing youtubers. The movie reviewers are very quiet on the matter, not even a single post about Cuties/Mignonnes anywhere. Once the movie is out and they give their review proper, anyone who give an ok to good review is gonna get some backlash and their fans will come to defend them.

Right now Netflix's trailer for Cuties/Mignonnes sits at 34k likes and 1.4mil dislikes. I doubt we will have a reverse but if the movie is indeed as good as the Sundance reviews are, I'm guessing we'll see a 25% like ratio. Maybe the like will bump out to 250k at best.

Most of the first rage youtube commentators will either double down on their stance or change their stance from ""this movie is bad"" to ""this movie is not my taste but Netflix marketing team is still bad"".","Cuties/Mignonnes will be out next Wednesday (9 Sept 2020), how do you think the reaction is going to turn out?"

I tried switching browsers(chrome, safari, firefox..), I am 100 percent sure that I have funds in my bank, I tried 2 different banks and 3 different debit cards, I also tried paying on my TV, on my phone, on my laptop, the same issue persists every time I try to pay. I switched Wi-Fi, I still got the same message.

After some googling, I found out that some people have the same issue, and they get over it by buying a gift card. So, I did just that. I got a gift card for 25€ and when I add the code, I get a message saying that I got 25€ credit, but I still have to add a payment method. When I try to add a payment method, the same issue persists, the message: ""There appears to be a problem with the payment method you are trying to use.""

I spoke with support 2 times, in the end i just got some web links and they told me that I should contact my bank, AND that my gift card code does not work...
