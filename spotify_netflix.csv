"Spotify sound quality is trashI recently bought a samsung phone (several months ago) and got a free premium subscription to youtube music and am blown away by the sound quality. Everything is just louder and crisper. I liked it so much that I kept paying for it on top of spotify. 

But I've missed the social aspect of spotify's playlists. Being able to stay on top of the newest trending songs, having a desktop app, etc. But everytime I open it up, I can hear how muddled everything is. Then I open that same song in YT Music and it's like the wax is taken out of my ears.

Just today I was listening to SZA's newest song, Good Days because it was on top of the top 50 (yesterday). The intro just sounded weird. So I opened it on YT music and played it on my built-in laptop speakers. Suddenly I notice their are birds chirping in the background, kids yelling , little record scratches/chirping effects, all of these things add up to a really evocative intro that I can't even hear in the intro to the spotify version *after realizing its there*.

I just really need spotify to get their shit together so I can stop paying for two services.",1,1143,212

"I think my account may have been hacked. Can y'all help me?Today I went to listen to Spotify on my family premium account, and instead of connect via bluetooth to my car like it does every day, it said it was playing on a Safari Web Browser somewhere, and it was playing this Russian ambient music. Now, hours later, I went to try to listen to a podcast like I do every day on my evening walk, and it is still playing on that web browser, still Russian ambient music. I click to change the device it is playing on, and it changes to my phone for about two seconds, then changes back. When I change what is playing, it will play my music or podcast for about one second then changes back. I can see in my listen history it has been playing this ambient Russian music all day. I have asked my family if it is any of them, and they all said no. I changed my password, but I still can't get it to work. Any ideas?

"New Theory Regarding Spotify RadioSo, I see a lot of complaints about how repetitive the Spotify radio has become.  

Well, I agree. But I think I found a way to make it be less so.  

So, type in the name of a song you like and let the radio take over. But instead of listening to the song, skip the rest of it. And then keep skipping every song that you have heard a million times that come after.  I have found that what happens is that all of a sudden I start getting new songs that I haven't heard before. You maybe have to skip as many as 10 songs or so, but it does seem to work.  

I'd be curious if others try this, how it works for you.",1,646,131

My podcast app has explicit settings to not only download while on wi-fi, but while also plugged in, so it usually only downloads after I go to sleep.

I don't use the spotify app too much while I'm home, and my work wi-fi blocks Spotify. So it really kills the mood when I open up the app to play music and all the offline playlists are just waiting to download. Is there a way to fix this other than manually opening the app each night? How can the #1 app not have this basic functionality? Also, I know they've gotten into podcasts in the past couple of years; is it the same case on the podcast side? Would be crazy to use a podcast app that can't download on a schedule like any normal app does.",1,1024,193

"Over 2gb of cellular data used the past 24 hours, but I've only listened to spotify for maybe an hour topsJust started using spotify again (last time I used it was maybe 2 years ago).  I set up a new account, added playlists, some are downloaded.  I played some music over the past day, which couldn't have accounted for an hour of playtime, and it's used over 2 gb of my cellular data.  I have downloads over cellular turned off.  I get that streaming will use cellular data if I haven't downloaded the particular playlist, but I can't understand how it's used that much data for so little use.  Are there any troubleshooting steps I should try?  I'm using android phones.

Edit, to be explicit--the Spotify app itself has used over 2gb of cellular data, but I've only listened to music through it for maybe an hour tops.

Second edit--apparently I'm not alone, and this isn't an android-specific issue, it's a way that Spotify behaves in general.  It's been most-recently complained about here:  https://community.spotify.com/t5/iOS-iPhone-iPad/Spotify-using-mobile-data-even-when-cellular-data-turned-off/m-p/5083015/highlight/true

Basically even if you have playlist downloads turned off for cell data, if you are listening to a playlist that you have downloaded, the playlist can still ""update"" over cellular data.

"What the hell is happening with my playlist?Okay, so first of all, the Spotify update has its sweet points; folders to organize my playlists, hotkey manuals, ....... THAT'S IT!


The new Spotify update (desktop) sucks, and I think all my friends can agree with this. People can't copy and paste songs from playlists anymore, switching from playlists will always bring you to the top (good, if you're not sorting out a playlist of 200..), you can't sort by artist as easily, searching for songs become more tedious, I can't just click a song title in the search page to pull out the album, if I add a bunch of songs into a playlist and you have some of them already in it, they seldom notify that there are duplicates, having to confirm when using the delete key when deleting multiple songs, and many more.


But the worst is definitely the playlists. I think the inclusion of album arts can be appealing to some, but not for me. Weirdly enough, Spotify has not implemented a feature where you can choose what to show in the playlists. Not only that, everything is sort of worse, performance-wise... If I scroll through my playlist, it loads, it did not use to load... 


Arranging song orders used to be okay, but now, if I delete something, it basically has a chance to just scramble my playlist, and I don't know why... This really made me give up organising my song orders... THIS HAPPENED TO ME TWICE, A MONTH AGO, AND JUST NOW. PLAYLIST OF 300 SONGS, I WAS HALFWAY FINISHED, AND IT SCRAMBLED ITSELF BECAUSE OF SOME REASON. Ctrl + z don't work, and honestly, I'm about to give up organising my playlist... This app is really trying to push me over the edge, and I just decided to go premium just now...",1,1707,308

"Why does Spotify insist on burying playlists? Are they trying to make it hard to find music?I‚Äôve recently realised that there are so many official Spotify Playlists that I‚Äôve never seen. Some of them I only found when I search for playlists with the name of the genre/any random word, some of them by scrolling through Spotify‚Äôs account. Some of them are really good. 
I don‚Äôt understand why the page for each genre only shows ‚ÄúPopular Playlists‚Äù. Just put them all there. 

Also, and maybe this is actually common knowledge, but apparently these playlists aren‚Äôt the same for everyone? When I was putting on music from my friend‚Äôs phone, the songs on ‚ÄòVolume‚Äô were completely different. It wasn‚Äôt because it was updated or anything, they were still the same on my phone. 

Sometimes they have really random names, or they‚Äôre unrelated to the songs. And the descriptions sometimes name artists that aren‚Äôt actually on the playlists. There are several playlists with the same name. I‚Äôve found like three called ‚Äú90‚Äôs workout‚Äù, all from Spotify‚Äôs account. Were the 2000s some sort of golden age for jazz? Because both ‚Äúsmooth jazz 2000‚Äù and ‚Äúvocal jazz 2000‚Äù exist, but equivalents for other decades don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre AI generated, but Spotify seems to claim they‚Äôre not, unless I‚Äôve misunderstood. 

On top of that, there‚Äôs the fact that you can‚Äôt filter searches. This is probably relevant for more people here. Every time I try to decide what to listen to, I wish I could just use filters, like what Ultimate Guitar has where you start with literally everything they have and you can start narrowing it down.

They don‚Äôt even let you see every genre/mood! It‚Äôs pretty much a guessing game. Nevermind the fact that we know they sort things into way more genres/subgenres than what users can see classified as such. Spotify‚Äôs been telling me my favourite genre is ‚Äúpermanent wave‚Äù for years. Then let me see what it is! 

They have these collections of playlists that go together, but they don‚Äôt let you browse them.

What‚Äôs the point? What‚Äôs their endgame here? If it‚Äôs to get people to spend hours hyper-fixating on this and trying to figure out what‚Äôs going on instead of actually listening to music, well they‚Äôve succeeded. Sorry for the rant, it‚Äôs just really frustrating.",1,2289,388

Spotify is a great streaming service, but I understand that they accept payola to keep surviving, but hopefully this will change in the future, and they will recommend music that you actually like yourself.

Anyway, Long Live to Spotify",1,584,95

I want to get the STUDENT bundle and cancel the Hulu (ads) / Disney +/ESPN + bundle BUT I'm worried it's going to mess up my Spotify algorithm is it starts over with a new subscription. I'm also worried it would mess up my watch list for my current Showtime and Hulu.

"question about what counts/will show up as an album on Spotify?Ive got 9 songs recorded that I will be releasing relatively soon. My question is will this come up as an album (as opposed to saying its a single or EP) due to the fact its 9 songs (over 30 mins in length). Is there a way you can specify it is an album and not an EP? I use distrokid.

I'm a music addict who appreciates all genres, and at the request of some friends, have started to try and summarise all music genres I like into catchy, long but specifically chosen playlists. It's proving a little tricky to get traction for all the hard work, but as long as a few people find things they love each time, I'm happy :)

Here's all the ones made so far for you to hopefully discover a lot of awesome new music broken down by main genre-

"Classical music list (may be nice to reading)Link:
https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7hUeaTHN2xMdqrl4WPuXw4?si=kW_PJQ6oT-mU7sUTXkn_Pg

It is a 1-hour list of classical music, songs that I really like, whose tempo goes up and down.

If you like to listen to music while reading a book, I would definitely recommend that you play it once in a short reading session. I collected the list for this purpose and continue to add it. Or a list that will go well while working, even if it finishes a few times and starts over.

The list take just 1 hour, but as I listen to classical music, I make additions from time to time. So you can follow the list if you like it.

Thanks and wish you all good listening &lt;3",1,706,122

"Radio without using personal flavor/""preferences""?I'm a big user of the radio and weekly discovery. Sometimes after going into a rabbit hole, I find something of a completely different genre and I want to find more of it. So naturally I start a radio based on that song/artist.

The issue here is that it will add songs that aren't remotely the same as the thing I'm using the radio for. It is adding songs that are more like my recently listened to genres/artists. It really defeats the point of radio-ing on a specific song or artist outside of the genres I've listened to over the last few months.

For example, I'm attempting to find more Japanese ""chillhop"". I've found a couple artists doing this genre, put them in a playlist, and started a radio on it. Only a fraction of the results are somewhat like the songs in the list, the rest is all just j-pop, instrumental, or variations of EDM.

Is there a way to start a radio with a ""clean"" profile, so to speak, not biased by my listening history?",1,1002,181

"Looking for songs for a certain mood.Hi guys, I've recently been having the blues, almost hitting 30 and looking back in my life I feel like I was dealt a horrible hand to begin with, I have this ""adolescent"" feeling of unfairness and angst but more bitter, yesterday I found myself both pissed off at myself/the world/my family/etc and some songs started resonating heavily (listed below) all of them have the same feeling of regret, anger, sadness, and those kind of feelings. I'm not looking for openly aggressive stuff like death metal, but rather the kind of songs which really have meaningful lyrics with a darker tone.

- Creedence / Bad Moon Rising
- Creedence / Fortunate son
- Creedence / Have you seen the rain
- Aerosmith / Dream on
- Radiohead / Creep
- Billy Joel / Piano man
- Meat loaf / The monster is loose
- Meat loaf / Life is a lemon and I want my money back

"Volume levels from spotify on Console appThere is a volume setting which can be accessed easily from the quick menu. The problem is that the very lowest option is what I would consider half volume. And if you move it down to 0 from 1 it just turns it completely off. 


And the highest option is either extremely high or its extremely high and boosts the bass and sometimes it blurs whatever is being said in the song when there is intense bass and all you hear is the bass covering the words(this doesn't happen at max volume on pc and it still sounds just as loud but the words aren't covered by the base). I imagine if I had crappy headphones it would be even worse and I'd hear absolutely nothing else.


Either way it would be way better if the lowest volume option was no sound and the first tick was nearly non-exist. I have to stop my music sometimes just to hear footsteps in games. For it being the console app where it's supposed to be easy since you can't just adjust the volume levels for separate applications like on pc it's really annoying that the lowest option is basically the same volume as the game audio. 


When the slider is at 50-75% it's as loud as music needs to be listened too. There is absolutely no need to go all the way to the farthest tick. I definitely think that the bass is boosted as well, since even at that level the bass sounds shaky on good headphones. Although I don't really care if that's the case and I just want to be able to listen to my music on low volume and still play games while hearing what's happening.",1,1558,294

"Why so much hate towards Spotify, have you tried the other services?I‚Äôm baffled by how much hate Spotify gets here, ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs so bad‚Äù ‚ÄúNO SHUFFLE‚Äù ‚ÄúPodcasts sucks‚Äù 
Have you tried the other services, like seriously? 

First of Spotify has some issues and things that can be improved I agree on that, but some advantages: 

- Best algorithmic playlist by far
- Great tool to discover new music
- Easy to curate playlists
- A lot of well curated editorial lists
- Great UI and nice design

After trying Apple Music, Amazon and Tidal, I‚Äôm like, yea why even complain? Amazon was a big disappointment and Apple music, I‚Äôm not impressed. 
So please before complaining that Spotify is so bad, look at your options, they ain‚Äôt better",1,725,127

"Considering leaving Spotify...I switched to Spotify about half a decade ago from Apple Music because Spotify was far superior for discovering new music. That‚Äôs the name of the game for me. Idk if others are experiencing similar things, but Spotify has been really decreasing in quality lately...

To start, my discover weekly for the last couple years has been nothing but songs from previous discover weekly‚Äôs that Ive heard and deliberately didn‚Äôt add to my library.. so Spotify should know I don‚Äôt like those songs

Additionally, any song radio that I make is comprised of songs that are already in my library, like Spotify thinks Im trying to make my own daily mix. No. I‚Äôm trying to find new songs. 

The hide button on mobile is too hidden, the app glitches, you can‚Äôt remove a song from a playlist on mobile, you can‚Äôt adjust EQ on desktop, and the fact that Spotify still doesn‚Äôt have an independently working app for the Apple Watch is a joke. 

To not be a total downer I will say I quite like the equalizer (even if it isn‚Äôt on desktop, I don‚Äôt think Apple has it), collaborative playlists, crossfading, how easy it is to transition from listening on different devices, and the social aspects of the app.",1,1215,213

"Instagram music is only showing me Latin songs...To get this straight I live in Canada.

When I want to post a photo on my story and use the music option it only shows me Latin and Indian music. 

I can search any North American artist and they will not show up. This just started happening today so I don't know what happened.

I thought that maybe I was being hacked by someone in India so I unlinked my FB, changed my password, reinstalled the app twice and restarted my phone and nothing.

I can't search music in the app anymore as it just doesn't show me because it thinks I'm in a country that I'm unsure of... 

My play store and Spotify and Facebook are all Canadian and location is showing as Canadian so I'm not sure what's going on.

\--------

I just want to make a playlist with one artist's discography in chronological order. **What I need is a release date column.** On Windows.

Playing from artist page doesn't work for me, because the artist in question has worked with a sex offender or two that I refuse to support financially, so my goal is to make a discography playlist and remove the songs with problematic artists. (FYI: Fat Nick and Pouya are actual rapists. Look for the Twitter thread.) So, making a discography playlist: how hard can it be? Well...

* From the artist page, I would have to

1. select all songs from a given EP/LP
2. drag to playlist in sidebar, or right click and select ""add to playlist"" &gt; playlistName.
3. Multiplied by every EP or LP.

* For ""Appears On"" (features), it gets worse:

1. click the project
2. find the songs featuring the artist
3. add to playlist
4. navigate backwards to get to the next project.
5. Multiplied by every featured track.

What I ***should*** be able to do:

1. Go to artist page
2. Select all tracks &gt; Add to playlist
3. Sort playlist by release date and play as is, or copy sorted playlist to new playlist for a permanently chronological discography playlist.

The problem with this is that selecting songs from multiple albums at once on artist page is not supported, and ""Appears On"" tracks are hidden behind another layer of navigation, so they can't be multi-selected.

The easy way ***would*** be to

1. search artist name
2. sort by release date
3. select all &gt; add to playlist

However, the order of tracks in search results is based on popularity, so there is no chance of this method being feasible: the songs from a given project are interspersed with others, and the resulting playlist would be a mess. For search results, it's not even possible to click a column to sort (by album in this case) so I can cross reference my new playlist with artist page and then sort whole projects by date manually. **Column sorting should be enabled for search results.** You might think this isn't an option because sorting very long search results is resource-intensive. However, the feature could be disabled for results of &gt;= X length ‚Äî say, 100 or 500 results ‚Äî and they are already sorted by popularity, so this is bogus.

I should at least have the **option** to enable a release date column that I can use to sort playlists and search results. **iTunes had this figured out over a decade ago.** I have paid Spotify hundreds of dollars over the years, and they are still so far behind. I just want to listen to one of my favorite artists for a couple hours without supporting rapists. Is that too much to ask?!?

Another solution for me would be to permanently forbid playing songs by a particular artist. Like a blocked list. This isn't an option either. The lack of this effectively ruins playing from some artist pages or community playlists for me, and forces me to make playlists. Also, playing from artist page doesn't play ""Appears On"" tracks. 

Right now the absurd, convoluted solution to making a chronological discography playlist is this:

1. Search artist name
2. Select all and add to playlist 1
3. Sort playlist 1 by album
4. Select all and add to playlist 2
5. Go to artist page and find earliest project
6. Go to playlist 2
7. Move earliest project to top of playlist (or bottom depending on desired order)
8. Repeat steps 5-8 for every project
9. Use Google to determine which LPs/EPs/features from the same year came first and adjust accordingly

But this week, even though the New Music Friday playlist is displaying all new songs (and says they were added 12 hours ago), when I select them all and drag them all into my new playlist, it isn't those songs that appear, but *last week's* songs- same goes for Friday Cratediggers.

"Release Radar &amp; Discover Weekly- WHY would I want playlists full of remixes, covers and live performances?This probably gets talked about here anyways, but I really wanted to vent about this. Not sure how many of you also experience this issue- or perhaps you like these playlist additions- but personally that's not why I want to listen to Discover Weekly &amp; Release Radar. I feel it didn't use to be this way, or at least not this bad. 

I wanted to say maybe they're lacking as much fresh content with the pandemic, but I don't think that's true. I've been finding new music through other means and there seems to be plenty of it. So that must not be the issue. 

I dunno, I just find it annoying how much of my playlists consist of live performances, shitty covers, or often shitty remixes of songs I've added to my library. That's just not what I was hoping for, y'know? 

Anyone else feel this way?",1,911,164

"Spotify desktop client only partially syncingTitle says it all. My desktop client began to act up about a month ago when I noticed that my current activity wasn't being displayed on Discord.

To make this situation even weirder, liking songs/updating playlists seems to work just fine. That's why I switched to the browser player, because there everything worked just fine.

I tried reinstalling the client multiple times over the past, downloading from both the Spotify website and Microsoft store to no avail. I also tried reconnecting [last.fm](https://last.fm) and Discord and that didn't work either. Tried setting everything to 'offline' for it to refresh and that didn't work either.

"Bunch of previously unavailable Japanese music now available on US Spotify 

As everyone who likes anime probably knows for the longest time a lot of older anime songs have not been available on US Spotify, but it seems that a lot of it for whatever reason has now been made available at the same time.

This includes music from:

* stance punks
* Judy and Mary
* sambomaster
* UVERworld
* Abingdon school boys
* asian Kung fu generation

There‚Äôs probably more I haven‚Äôt searched through everything yet. Most of these older Japanese bands either had very limited selections or no music at all on US Spotify but if you look now you can finally listen to their entire discographies.

"Retraining discover weekly?Looking for your success stories and strategies.

I have noisy upstairs neighbors. Like, they tap dance with a mountain goat at like 6:30 in the morning. I work nights. They wake me up all the time and it's a real inconvenience. I've started sleeping with background noise to try to improve my quality of sleep. Mostly I've been using things like video game soundtracks or soundscapes just to give a little bit of background noise so they're stomping around doesn't bother me as much.

after a couple of weeks my discover weekly was nothing but a bunch of ambient dreamy soundscapes and that's really boring. I mostly listen to metal and EDM so that's a big change for me. All of my playlists are metal and/or EDM. I read about how to wrangle discover weekly and made a bunch of new playlists and stopped listening to soundscapes.

That was about 3 weeks ago. I've continued to make playlists out of music that I do want to hear, but discover weekly is only giving me soft dreamy soundscapes. What can I do to expedite the change?",1,1057,187

"Apple Music vs Spotify in Q1 2021I have struggled over the past 2 years to really choose one of the two services and stick to it. I use mostly Apple products and love the design of Apple Music, the way the library works, the artist radio, lyrics feature and the way the CarPlay app works. However, Spotify has some cool features including the ability to see what friends are listening to, live group sessions, and the queue being better as well.

"Save money on spotify premiumso I was browsing through Gumtree and I found this seller, they are offering really cheap spotify premium subscriptions.


Apparently what they are doing is they are buying these accounts from countries like philippines or india, where it costs $4 a month and selling it for cheap.

"Possible fake Spotify listens?So my partner is a musician and makes a decent living and has an okay Spotify listenership.

About Spotify though - he has noticed that a couple of times a month a lot of his songs will get close to 4 or 5 hundred extra listens a day and all of these come from a place called Riverside in California. And of course this causes a fairly ugly and obvious and possibly fake spike in his listenship.

He says it looks like what paid listens would look like but of course he doesn't do that.

Anyone know anything it could be (its definitely not genuine listens - couple be 400 listens each for 8 songs in one day) or does riverside have a particular significance for Spotify?

Also please direct me to a better sub if you know anywhere more suitable for this question.

Cheers :)",1,805,149

"Android crashing, nothing seems to workMy wife has a Galaxy S10.  We have been subscribed to Spotify premium duo since Octoberish, no problems at all with Spotify.  On Christmas we both got smart watches, she got a Galaxy Watch 3.  her Spotify started crashing then when she tried to listen to it using her watch.  

She then uninstalled it from her watch, but the phone app has been crashing ever since.  She has told me that she needs to uninstall/reinstall Spotify once a day to use it.  She has done soft resets, closing the app, clearing caches, everything short of a factory reset of her phone, which she does not want to do.  Has anyone encountered this and fixed it?",1,674,120

"Local Files (Adding any song to Spotify for free)I don‚Äôt know how many of you know this, but there‚Äôs a feature where you can add MP3 files to Spotify. In the event Spotify doesn‚Äôt have a specific song or audio file you want to listen to, you can just get the MP3 file of the song/video and save to a folder on your laptop, so that it will show up in the local files tab on your desktop. To make the Local Files tab show up you need to go into advanced settings and turn it on. The only downside is that only you can view the song, because only you have the MP3 file on your desktop. 

Once you add the file to a playlist, it will pop up on your phone (I‚Äôd recommend keeping your phone open to the playlist you want to add the song to, because it sometimes doesn‚Äôt show up if your phone is turned off while you add the song onto a playlist from your desktop). You can‚Äôt add local files through your phone alone. They will show up accessible on your phone if you add it through desktop.

You can also add album art by going thru iTunes (or any other desktop media player) and adding artwork to the song. You‚Äôd first need to drag and drop the file into whichever media player you‚Äôre using. 

A lot of my friends use Spotify and they had no idea you could do all this. So in the event people are not aware of this feature, I thought I‚Äôd just mention it here on Reddit. Happy listening!

P.S. Googling ‚ÄúLocal files for Spotify‚Äù might help you with the process much easier than my explanation.",1,1487,288

Something happened and the quality dropped drastically. It's way more saturated and blurry and I have no clue why. It's been a few hours since I uploaded the canvas so I doubt it's a processing problem. I spent some time creating it and would hate to take it down because it's looking bad on the platform.

"Spotify needs to change the way it removes songs/albumsI am sure a lot of you have had this issue. You look up a song/album to listen, only to find it has since been removed or is unplayable (if you have the show missing songs option enabled).

A notification to users who have saved a song/album in advance - at least a week prior, would be a better idea. So we are not taken by surprise and can have our fill of the song/album before it vanishes.

However, when I put it on shuffle, which is most of the time, I will get multiple songs in a row and it seems like it's getting worse. Over the summer I'd get 3 or 4 in a row. Tonight I was listening in the shower and after the first song, it changed genre and played probably 6 tracks of the same artist, then 3 of a different, but similar artist, then 3 more of the previous artist, 2 of a new artist, and then just started going back and forth between two artists in a new genre. skip skip skip skip...

Is there a switch or something to make this stop or does the algorithm just suck?

Now both artist pictures are permanently at the top of my android app and pc app. I've unfollowed both, I've removed both from the Recently Played tab on the left side, they still appear at the top of the home page under recently played.

Normally I wouldn't really care but the artist bio image for Fever Ray is really gross and for reasons I'd rather not get into is a bit of an emotional trigger so I'm in a shitty mood every time I open spotify and see it.

"[Question] Spotify thinks that a 5 minutes long local file is 14 seconds longThis is a bit of a weird one and it's nothing that I care too much about, I would just like to know what's causing it, and if it's something that can be fixed.

In Gustav Mahler's second symphony, He specifies a 5-minute pause between the first and the second movement, so I pulled up audacity and made a 5-minute long recording of literally nothing (which is why I called it a local file and not a song in the title) and then plugged it into the playlist. The first and second movements are also in different albums in this specific case, so a playlist was more or less necessary.

The file in question plays for five minutes, but the length displays for 14 seconds in the playlist. Here's a [screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/hzM1Ju0.jpg). I've also tried a one minute file, which also displays 14 seconds for whatever reason. Didn't attach a picture for that one because I'm lazy.

Anyone got any idea what's happening here and if/how it can be fixed?

"Thinking of switching : Question about the artist feed and donation (tip?) buttonThe main reason I am with Tidal is because they pay out way more than the other platforms. My main thing is making sure the artists are getting paid as much as possible. I've been saying for years Spotify needs to adopt a tip / donate button, and now they finally have done it so I'm considering switching.

&amp;#x200B;

1. How good is the artist feed ? Is it easy to use and do you use it often ? I'm speaking of the feed that lets you know of the artists new releases.  

2. How widespread is the tip button ? Are you guys noticing it on a lot of profiles ? Any idea about the roll-out of this function or its timeline ?

"Podcast Ads w/PremiumI pay for Spotify premium so that I don‚Äôt have ads, they annoy me and I loose focus so easily because of them. 

One thing that has started to frustrate me more and more is when podcasts put ads in their episode, mainly the middle, and Spotify plays them. 

It is so frustrating to pay for premium to not have ads, then there are ads anyways. While I know it‚Äôs not Spotify putting them in, they are still allowing it. They could say no ads in the middle of the podcast, they could skip them for me, etc.

"Easy fixes and options that should not be missing/changed. Please help me understand why! [Android User]Where do I find ""create folder"" on the android app?
Don't tell me that there is no such option. This app is ~10 years old.
I love Spotify but many small things are making me wonder what the fuck they are doing. 

Stuff like:
- Selecting multiple tracks at once.
- Undoing a missclick, like by mistake deleting a track.
- Not having to wait a fucking second to click an option under ""more options"" because some options appear later which makes you missclick.
- WHY THE FUCK CAN'T ""FIND IN PLAYLIST"" BE ON TOP OF THE SCREEN LIKE IT USED TO?
- If someone is following my playlist I should be able to see, at least, username of that account.
- If someone visits my profile they should see the playlist like I sort them and in their folders, AND half of my library is not even showing (I have many playlist).

BTW, did this team earlier this year delete the widget for Spotify? (I know it's back).

Like, look I get it Spotify, you need to recommend me different content to make money, and your algorithms are pretty good, but, like all algorithms they're like 60% at best. You showed me something you thought I might like. You were wrong. Why in the HELL can I not nuke this from orbit and NEVER see it again?

I could maybe go down the playlist and manually add one song at a time to a newly created personal playlist and then remove the ones I don't like.  That would take some time.  Maybe there are some hacks and tricks to do it faster.  But then the playlist won't get any updates.  I mean what if the original playlist creator was still working on their playlist and adding new songs each day?  It would be better and make more sense to click on the song in that person's playlist and then select ""ignore song"" from the menu.  So when the previous song is done playing, it will try to play the ignored song, realize it is ignored, and then just skip it and play the next song.  Is that so hard to implement?",1,902,166

BUT!

When I follow the album link from my, say ""Likes Songs"" playlist, when it's playing, it brings me to a view where it does show the correct ""likes"" and activity.

"Issues with downloaded songsAnyone else having issues with not being able to play downloaded songs ""because there is no internet connection""
I have become increasingly frustrated with this app do to this issue. 
My commute takes me through an area where there is no service. That being the case I downloaded a lot of music to my device, the only registered device on my account. 
Still when there is no service I can't pull up albums or songs to start playing music, worse yet it stops playing in the middle of my commute when a song ends. I commute on a motorcycle so it isn't very straight forward for me to be fucking around with the app mid ride. 
I have also.doscovered that spotify has just undownloaded about 50% of my downloaded music. 

Why the hell is a premium paid for app of a publicly traded company so damn bad. It is literally their only fucking product. Google has tons of shit they make, I'll give them a pass if their music players sucks. 

Don't even get me started on the general poor UI experience. I really like being able to discover new artist via spotify but being frustrated on 3 out of 5 days of my commute because the app doesn't perform is getting old. I don't want to listen to wind noise for 40 minutes twice a day.",1,1247,230

"I can't seem to get the automatic startup to stopI'm on spotify desktop and cannot stop it from autostarting. Setting the in-app setting to ""no"" does nothing, Spotify isn't even an entry in the task managers ""startup"" tab, and even when i disable it using something like [AutoRuns](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/sysinternals/downloads/autoruns?redirectedfrom=MSDN), it still autostarts.

Now i looked into this online and the [solution](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Desktop-Windows/Auto-starting-even-when-disabled/m-p/1735295#M20888) proposed, was to disable ""Allow Spotify to be opened from the web"". But when i go into my own settings, that option just isn't there! (I wanted to put a screenshot here, but r/Spotify doesn't allow that, so you'll just have to take my word for it.)

So, does anyone have a solution to this? Spotify autostarting is getting really annoying.",1,881,121

[**COMMON PEOPLE - Brit-Pop &amp; Indie Classics &lt; 2010**](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2V1Kl9wxLNOsp97AMXfoHx?si=WmQC4rayRXqI55sK4QY8oA) / *350+* catch all hits station from that 90s and 00s indie-rock sound, especially in the UK.

[**BITTER SWEET SYMPHONIES - Violins of the British Isles**](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4cj5rylS8pDmrovtRbtJhe?si=ULDsCWkxTZaRKmuHMt8D0g) / *170+* songs of which 90% are indie-rock, with the rest made of classic rock &amp; pop and trip-hop with prominent violins from bands across the British Isles.

[**SLEEPWALKERS - Dreamy Indie/Pop**](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7nPWcacMWrOO5uEqM5i7bP?si=D4HmZN-NRmeYPtb4kH7Zjw) / Dream-pop (indie) weaved in between dreamy feeling pop/alt songs. *375* catchy floaty songs to get lost in.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***ELECTRONIC***

[**JAH WAR ‚Äì Sounds of Dread**]( https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6byGQms2WCbtP7lQP2jJSh?si=_858ku0ZTg2T5Wy2XgmM6Q) / This can be seen as a conceptual playlist for a Jamaican apocalyptic party (sounds of dread as in the sense of dread but also dreadlocks). But another musical way to look at is as a dancehall/dub/industrial playlist explored mainly through the sonic output of The Bug. *80+* songs.

[**DIESEL POWER ‚Äì Industrial x Electronic**]( https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4FF03inHf4SZ857sBZoIFS?si=XlNUYw71Ryu_H3hRSMFEYQ) / An energetic playlist of electronic songs with industrial aesthetics and vice versa with loose definitions. There should be a drum or synth hitting at you every second. *160+* songs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***HIP-HOP***

**[YOUNG KINGS &amp; QUEENS - UK Hip-Hop/CHILL](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1tXmfbEbqGUXdXnlMprM1N?si=rjwDnnb_RVODOKRf7Ps0wg)** / If you're a hip-hop fan who appreciates bars, I'd say you're pretty up to date with the UK scene if you listen to these *180+* songs and the next playlist.

**[SCARE THE SNARE - UK Hip-Hop/HYPE](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6Ybykk20eEI9p3DpXxv22N?si=YFgg_2kuStuY7CAu-SXeNA)** / More aggressive bars and beats on these *160+* tunes. But still no low effort rhymers.

**[THE BAY - Funk x Hip-Hop](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7gNuSGvIJldJ4XpiBIcxaO?si=-FjVroE5RlyfwYVC4IQaHw)** / *110+* songs of smooth, slick rhymers from The Bay in San Francisco (or close by) on funky production or bands.

**[LYNGUISTICS - Blues x Hip-Hop](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/628bofbI24qf24gpU0aurB?si=6rCpfHUoSIu4Vy_q3pR8Zw)** / While this is a blues x hip-hop playlist, it's pretty much explored through the focus of one group: Cunninlynguists. I hope you'll see why with *90+* songs of mellow soulful bluesy production.

**[BLUEGRASS STAIN'D - Blues-Rock x Hip-Hop](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6YKWBVOKzpbZ4I1ruO1NFs?si=3dJ1Zt8fQ5uT-vQtdYKHMQ)** / It would be a stretch to call all of the *190+* tracks on here blues-rock, but there is at least bluesy guitar. They're all hip-hop songs with differing ratios of blues and rock influence to the production, so probably one of the most varied hip-hop playlists.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***OTHER GENRES***

**[LET‚ÄôS GROOVE - A Trip Down Funkytown](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/24TtMVEkD9mpajyjimsKfx?si=NqyPCG_dSVK9B_eYxCLfcA)** / Get your Funk on with this playlist bridging the gap between oldschool funk and it's evolution and divergence since. *270+* songs.

**[VOODOO - Tribal Drums](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0VmNQckTd8RTdiuRkWIwny?si=c_ZJWCmCSg-PPcEkIE5SQQ)** / Songs focused on tribal sounding drums but not just from tribally-bands. *110+* songs.

**[SEASONS IN THE SUN - A Cross-Generational Ode to Sol](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3h4Qe7wAq2UYiiFTdOvqpd?si=eFX-ut8YRZavdP8Lp3vvKg)** / Positive vibes from sunny, happy songs from across the generations, with about half pre-90s and half 90s onwards. *180+* songs.

"Bug that makes songs cut off midway through, when the app is closedRecently I‚Äôve been getting this bug where I would put a playlist on shuffle, and then close the app. About a minute after closing the app, the song cuts out. The only way I‚Äôve found to stop this is by either keeping the app open the entire time, or by opening the app every 20 seconds or so

I‚Äôve looked online and found that this happens to many android devices, and if low power mode is turned on, but I‚Äôm experiencing this on an iPhone, and my low power mode is turned off

If anyone know what to do, I would really appreciate it

TL;DR: Spotify cuts out mid song when the app is closed, help would be appreciated",1,683,131

"Ways to Add all ""Liked Songs"" Into a Playlist? It should be Easy But Basic way is not working! And it's Driving me Crazy!!On PC The basic way to add all liked songs to a Playlist is to hit control + A Then select add to new Playlist..
 HOWEVER, When I press control A it only selects about 100 songs NOT All my Songs, 
If I try and Use shift key and scroll down manually Songs are also missed!! 
I wonder if Spotify changed some code in an update?
As I have used these methods previously with No problem. 

I have 4, 427 liked songs, I want them in a Playlist! 
So I can then share it, 
But no matter what combination of control A or Shift I use this simply isn't Working. 
It is So Frustrating!

"Daily Mixes mixing unrelated genres making them unsuitable for their purposeI used to listen to a lot of Daily Mixes. They did a great job of cycling my music, while staying within the genre. Blues stayed with blues, metal with metal, etc.

In recent weeks I've noticed that they're completely off kilter. They might go from Arch Enemy to Joe Bonamassa in one song. I listen to both, but I wouldn't listen to them back-to-back - and Daily Mixes would have never done something like that previously.

Anyone else notice this?",1,524,91

"I am madly frustrated about the UI bugs that are never fixedMy biggest gripe is that jumping to songs by clicking on the album art is STILL bugged. I think the bug was introduced five years ago?

Another is the removal of jumping to artists or songs by typing. In other programs with lists (browsers, file explorers) you can just start typing something and it will be selected. Spotify had this feature in the olden days. It was suddenly removed and has never returned. You could even sort by artist, album or song and type to jump to them. It was a very smooth way of navigating a large playlist without having to use ctrl+F.

Can you believe that clicking album art still jumps to the wrong song? I first downloaded Spotify in 2008, and the current client is still a way worse experience. I'm also 99% sure that scrolling through playlists was a way smoother and faster experience on the old client.

I know I'm just shouting into the void here, but Spotify UI might be the biggest frustration in my daily life (maybe)",1,1020,185

"Is it possible to report tracks with false artists listed?For the past few months my release radar has consistently had 2 or 3 (in my opinion) **awful** songs.

However, I think I found out why these artists keep showing up in my feed: they'll list a very popular artist as a co-creator who is most certainly not a part of the music whatsoever.

Here's an example with Foreigner (yes, the rock band) listed as a co-author, who certainly have no part in the song: https://open.spotify.com/track/5XydV2296z91EwmTBtotAB?si=YiFcE8r0RtaHQnksnxTjkA

"Daily Mixes not as Distinct Anymore?Hi there, I‚Äôve been using Spotify for 5 years and generally still enjoy it. 

I used to love my daily mixes. They were each a distinct sub genre: top 40, hip hop/ RnB, 80s, dance pop, alt rock, etc 

Lately however most of the daily mixes just blur together the same sub genres or types of artists all across the mixes. There‚Äôs no rhyme or reason to each playlist anymore, and I really don‚Äôt like it as much. There‚Äôs no one daily mix anymore that fulfills a need or mood.

"Spotify premium keeps pausing during songs and automatically casting.Hi guys, for that past four or five days my spotify has been playing me up. I only use it on my phone and as I walk everywhere I listen to a lot of music. It started just randomly pausing which was irritating, now I can be trying listen to a song at home and it just skips to some obscure song I have never heard of. It has also casted to people's Web players as I am walking which is irritating. I have logged in and out, turned my phone off of power saving mode and uninstalled and then reinstalled the app and nothing is working, I am now at the point where I am considering just cancelling my subscription all together as it gets rather upsetting and frustrating when you can't even get through a minute of a song.

Some important points though, that you need to know before PMing me -


- we plan on taking a yearly plan which costs Rs. 2,159/- so we have to split as Rs. 360 per head. (which is Rs. 30 per month, as I mentioned above)

- Final payment will be done only after receiving the individual payments of all members. But this is negotiable. I'll add you to a whatsapp/discord group where we can talk and settle things, and you may pay only after you're convinced that we're not a scam.

- we're paying for a year cuz we want premium for long term usage. If you just wanna try out for a month or two you probably shouldn't PM me.

That's about it. Please feel free to ask any query in the comment section or in my PMs. Thanks. Advance Happy New Year guysü§ü",1,1034,198

I did not expect her to get this choked up but she really was super thankful that so many of you took the time to listen to her music. I gave her a booklet and printed out all of the nice comments that were left on my previous post. She said she thinks she'd like to professionally record more music in the future and you guys helped inspire her to do that :)

I'm literally still relying on JRE's YouTube clips to know when he's released a new episode. If they haven't implemented this feature it'll blow my mind. Takes 1 minute to add that feature to an app and it's as essential as getting notified about anything else you enjoy

Without it you stop keeping up...

Anyone know how to activate these if it is indeed possible? Searched and googled and found nothing so far

"Spotify automatically plays a sleep Playlist when charging at nightHi, I want to apologize in advance if this is common knowledge or answered before. I did search Google/Bing and YouTube several times and browsed a few keywords in this sub as well with no luck. 

Problem: Every night when I plug in my Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra it strangley triggers Spotify to begin playing relaxing music from a sleep Playlist that I never created nor listened to. I rarely use Spotify since creating an account years ago and I only recently installed it again on this new phone exclusively to listen to Joe Rogans podcasts. I dont ever use Spotify to listen to actual music when driving or other situations because I prefer Pandora instead. 

I have spent more time than I like to admit looking through the app settings and even logging in via web browser to find an option where I could stop the music from triggering automatically whenever I plug in my phone before bed. Even weirder is, I deleted all my Playlist and even disliked the sleep songs in an attempted to stop it and even force stopped Spotify before charging yet it still automatically plays sleep music every night when charging. 

My only remaining option I can think of is to sign out or delete my Spotify profile and create a new one to see if it continues to happen.

"Hey Spotify! Stop breaking immersion please!Recently moved to Spotify after being forced to use YouTube music which is horrendous in every way imaginable. One of the things that Google play music used to do was if you were listening to a song and you liked that song and wanted to hear more songs similar, you could simply select *start radio* while the song was playing and the song would not be interrupted and Google play music would append a playlist based on the song you're currently listening to and not interrupt anything. This was fantastic for parties and gatherings and worked well as moods change fluently during the party. With Spotify, if I hear a song that I like and want to hear more and go to the radio station based on that song I have to wait for the song to end before I can click play because it will start the song over again. Have you ever had a bunch of chicks listening to semi-charmed life only to have it restart a minute in? It pisses them off. It also decreases my chances of getting laid that evening. Spotify please fix this crap so I can get laid more often. 

Also while you're at it it would be great if I could just scroll up on the currently playing list to see what I previously played. Why in God's name do I have to go through four menus to find the recently played playlist on my Android device? It's like once that song is finished playing I'll never know what it was if I wasn't paying attention to the phone at the time. It's really nice to be able to go back and see what I've played because a lot of times I'll hear a song and I like to wear it out maybe I'll go back and listen to it three or four times. Sure I could add it to my ‚ù§Ô∏è songs but that's stupid if I know I just listened to it 10 minutes ago.  Yes, chicks like to listen to Semi-Charmed Life over and over again. 


I really miss Google play music. It was truly the golden-age app of music streaming. I consider it the worst loss of 2020.

Thanks for reading. Now if only had a way to remove Mariah Carey's All I want for Christmas is You on December 26th.",1,2066,398

"Song from ""liked"" playlist suddenly a different version.Today i wanted to listen to a song that i had in my ""liked"" playlist, and suddenly it was a different version of the song.

I liked the song over a year ago year ago and have listened to it many times. 
The original version that i had liked still exists on spotify.

 The song is: [Pata pata - Mariam Makeba ](https://open.spotify.com/track/6tR8N0wgzIoKaI7fmh0J0O?si=iEKI7dBQTpaNH5K2HmXnow)

This isn't the first time this has happened but this time i'm 100% sure.

[This](https://open.spotify.com/track/7d3cKDG22Ig9kZOS1qsq3S?si=jKWK6188Q92g1xnMWpvBvg) is the original version i had liked.

Has anyone else experienced this?
And can anyone explain why this happens?",1,722,103

"Is there a modified client of Spotify for Android?Imma be honest, the android app sucks so bad

- I can't see the total number of songs in playlists (literally why the fuck did you remove that)
- The search feature in playlist is hidden in the 3 dot menu (it's at the top of the playlist on iPhone so why is it different)
- In fact, why is everything in there ? It's a bitch to access when you are shaking I just want to sort my playlist 
- We have no sound personnalisation, like come the fuck on only 3 presets ?(again,unlike iPhone where. they can choose to boost the bass or others)
- Can't modify the description of playlists (maybe you can but then it's probably hidden)


Has someone tried to do a custom client for Android ? I know it exists on  windows but I ain't gonna carry this 5kg pile of garbage just for ""convenience""",1,833,159

I joined a group session with a friend of mine. After a bit, I left the group session. In both of our spotify applications, neither of us appear to be still in a group session. But if he tries to listen to music, my spotify keeps switching to whatever he is listening to every 30 seconds or so. So if I want to listen to music while he is on spotify as well, my spotify keeps switching to whatever he is listening to.

Now its constant ads just like the phone, if not worse. They seem to be frequent and long with many following ads after one another. Each seems to be 30 seconds long and it's about 3 or 4 each time.

"Spam-vertising in Spotify via Collaborative playlist?Hi all,

I recently created a new collaborative playlist that my friend and I share. I was going through it recently, and I found some tracks in there that I was sure neither of us would've added. Upon further inspection of the ""added by"" column, I found some nonsensical names I don't recognise:

https://imgur.com/JrXECCV

I clicked on the name, and it took me to this user:

https://i.imgur.com/RcrD4b6.png

This is pretty annoying. The playlist becomes marked as public once it is set as a collaborative playlist - so I guess it will appear in searches etc - then people can insert their tracks in there. This seems like an annoying oversight! As far as I can see, there is no way to mark a playlist as ""collaborative"" and then also lock down who can add to it.",1,818,141

So I'm a GPM refugee, and in GPM (and YTM), every song in your library is kept in a Songs page, with the ability to browse through it and also shuffle the entire library of songs. I can't find anything like this in Spotify? I see an Artists page and Albums page but no Songs page in my library. If looks like I have to manually add every single one of my albums into a playlist to accomplish this, which is extremely tedious when I'm adding several hundred albums, and I'm also worried about bumping up on the 10k song limit per playlist.

Is there really no way just to easily shuffle your entire library or am I missing something? This seems like it should be a basic feature.",1,708,132

But I noticed something, they would constantly play songs from artists with only one song. It was constant repeat of fake songs that had absolutely no sound. They‚Äôre fishing for our accounts and then using us to stream their fake music so that they can get freaking paid for the streams. I‚Äôm fuming that someone interrupted something as important to me as music, but god damn these scammers are getting creative. Every artist had their own art and their own unique name but the songs were just silence for the most part.

"Spotify's album recommendations are VERY flawed and user-unfriendlyI listen to a lot of spotify, and a lot of indie rock, so one of spotify's album categories on my home page is Best Indie Rock Albums of the 90s. To their credit, I've loved the albums they've recommended, like Cherry Peel, Emergency and I, and Brighten the Corners, but the problem is that they KEEP recommending albums that I've not only listened to, but actively downloaded and keep in my weekly listening diet. Obviously spotify keeps a comprehensive list of what music im playing, so why does it feel the need to suggest The Mollusk by Ween in the 90s indie rock category when its already in my Jump Back In?

Some added personalization would be much appreciated, maybe a feature like Youtube that marks an album as ""I've already heard this"" or ""Stop recommending me this"". Or just at least stop showing me albums that are literally in my downloads.",1,921,160

"I love making playlists and promoting underground artists!Hello! I'm a Spotify Playlist Curator by the name of LinktheFires with multiple playlists across Spotify. My motto is linking fire music to the people and I have a plethora of people that listen to my playlists daily so I figured I'd share them here! Most of them range from rap (trap specifically) to mellow beats (Lo-fi, Chillwave, Downtempo etc.)

All playlists are constantly curated and carefully cherry picked. Playlists contain both underground and well established artists. Our Spotify can be found [here](https://open.spotify.com/user/31epkvlkppx4prk5le5rda2gnjya?si=rhSvaNcySi-zyg9HcBhxYg) if you'd rather browse my catalog there!

"This is the reason why people switch to Apple MusicI've been using Spotify since 2013 (eversince it was available in my country) and I'm really enjoying it. Best 10 bucks I'm spending monthly. But after I bought my first iphone ever, i now see why so many folks are leaving spotify for apple music. 

Its not cause Apple Music has a better song library. Its just like it seems that Spotify is just too lazy when it comes to support for some things compared to apple music. I'll give you a few examples: 

1) I'm driving a BMW F30 with Idrive...it does work with spotify but i can control the music only with the idrive knob. However ever since I've been testing Apple Music (free 5 month trial) i can finally change AND select songs with my steeringwheel buttons, which is not possible on spotify. Further more i can go INSIDE the playlist and select a song i want to play. another thing thats not possible with spotify. Oh and the album cover is showing in the display as well with apple music. And im not even talking about the poor support with android phones 

2) Apple Shortcut/Siri integration: Works well with apple music. Spotify? not so much. The only thing you can do with shortcuts/siri is to open the damn app. Wanna set an automation when you come home to start a playing spotify or a certain playlist? Bad luck. Wanna tell siri to play something from spotify? Bad luck. 

3) Apple Watch: Apple music lets you save your songs for offline use on your watch so that when you're going out for a run, you dont need to bring a phone. Spotify? Nah, not possible. You can stream songs to the watch if you have the more expensive model but that was implemented like what....half a year ago? 

Spotify frustrates me more and more with such little things.

Instead of campaigning how unfair the 30% apple cut is, they should focus on supporting their Application to gain more paying customers!

"Has Spotify completely changed the way they do their 5 ""Popular"" songs for artists?So I got suspicious about this when I saw that [Taylor Swift](https://open.spotify.com/artist/06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02?si=wkG3QF4JQ_KXcj-gJ1Mq0A) dropped a new album, called Evermore. Right now, 3 of her top five songs are from this album, which dropped about a day ago, and Blank Space, which has TWO POINT SIX BILLION views on Youtube right now, is NOT present. 

Do artists get to just choose what their ""most popular"" songs are now? Because no way in hell is ""gold rush"", with 14 million streams, more ""Popular"" than Blank Space.

If Spotify has changed this model, they need to also change the title of the section to ""Featured"" instead of ""Popular"", because it is a flat out lie.

If you need another example, check out [Miley Cyrus's](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5YGY8feqx7naU7z4HrwZM6?si=Z07sby8CRX2XHc6N8z2QmA) page. It's a complete joke. No ""Party in the USA""? ""Malibu""?",1,965,144

"Is there a reason why Spotify won‚Äôt allow you to see what songs are already in playlists?I see this idea has been brought up before (years ago) on Spotify forums. 

For example, when you can‚Äôt remember what playlists (if any) you added a song too, why isn‚Äôt there an easy way just to see all the playlists that a song is in?

"Downloaded playlists sometimes hang when I try to open themI recently got Premium again and got to redownloading some of my favourite playlists to my phone for offline listening.  However, for some reason, I'll go to play an offline playlist and it will bring up the loading icon and just sit there.  It's usually near-instant, but I've tried leaving it for a few minutes and nothing changes.

I can fix this by opening my downloaded playlists while connected to the internet, but it's annoying to have to do, and I don't have a data plan so I can't do it while out and about.  It seems random as to which playlist(s) it affects as well, but it seems like more recently played ones are more likely, except if they were the last played (as in, Spotify is paused on a song from the playlist)

Has anybody encountered this?  Do you know how to fix it?

"Spotify &amp; Apple WatchThis is so frustrating.

Firstly, there's no offline storage so I cant take my (GPS) watch for a run and listen to my playlists without my phone (I've had to sign up to Apple Music, which is three months free at the moment, or transfer albums I already own and imported into iTunes).  Which is half the reason I wanted a smart watch.

Secondly, I have 'audio' devices all over running Spotify (PC, MacBook, Alexa).  So I figured my (expensive as fuck) watch would be able to remote control each device from my wrist, just like my phone can.

Except no.  Your watch only controls your phone.  Which then controls your Spotify on any device.

It works, but it's far from ideal because if, for any reason, your phone isnt on then you're screwed.  What's the point in having a remote control device if you're spending half your time ensuring your phone is alive and connected OK?!  Plus added battery drain on the phone.  

Not to mention that when you're out and about, with only your watch and phone, you have to be mindful of where your headphones are paired to (yesterday I ended up walking along with music coming from my backpack) because my Beats were paired to my watch, but Spotify (on the Watch) would only play music on the handset)

The watch itself seems a powerful and capable little device, but let down by piss poor programming.

Spotify; introduce offline Playlists and have the Watch take direct control of the Spotify apps installed on various network devices FFS.",1,1504,264

"Rant against lyrics being unavailablePlan : Premium¬†

Region : India¬†

Device : Poco X2, Android 10

App version : 8.5.87.921¬†

¬†
Been 6 months since I have been waiting for Musixmatch lyrics to appear in my account. No luck yet. When everybody else around me has the feature and they aren't even paying for premium, it really takes a lot away from the experience. Lyrics help in discovering new music.¬† Moderators in Spotify forums have mentioned that we are placed in a control ""Test Group"". Being in a ""Test Group"" for a seemingly infinite amount of time filled with frustration doesn't help with keeping customers hooked to the service.¬†

¬†

And how bad is the idea to create a new account and transfer music manually? That deletes all the followers, listening history, and you're left to retrain the algorithm on your listening habits. And most importantly, I paid for the entire year. I am not getting a refund on that, am I?

¬†

I tried clean reinstall and every possible hacks that would let me keep the original account at the end of the process. It looks like the only thing that works is shifting to a new account.¬†

Please stop providing impractical workarounds without keeping the original account. I keep using Spotify because it helps with discovering new music as I have been using it for a year and it knows me. I , may as well, shift to a different service if I am forced to create a new account anyway.¬†

Please stop with the ""Test Group"" replies. Testing shouldn't take a year.¬†

"Album/Playlist issue?So recently I found a metal playlist while browsing the genre. Ordinary playlist, but something about it is still extremely odd.

To start off with, I found it was weird that songs like Fade to black, ride the lightning and for whom the Bell tolls (by Metallica, from the album ride the lightning) had the image cover of Master of Puppets. Now when I clicked fade to black, (or any RTL song) it came up with RTL album cover, but when I clicked the song title, it took me to a compilation album called 'The Metallica Collection' from 2009, by Metallica. Weird.

Then, I noticed that some other songs' albums covers were noticeably darker than usual, etc Number of the beast, Phantom of the opera (iron maiden) So I clicked the song, and the album cover was the usual one that appears on Spotify. But when I clicked the song title, it took me to an album that looked exactly like the album that was in the playlist. No remaster, darker colours, and a bonus track that was unplayable. This was the iron maiden album iron maiden, but it happens with number of the beast, Powerslave, mellon collie and the infinite sadness; and the list goes on.
Even more weird, when I tried to search any of these albums up on Spotify, none of them would come up; only the remastered ones or the available ones. It seems that these albums/songs are only accessible via this particular playlist? Any ideas?

"YoutubeMusic refugee, new to Spotify.The grass isn't entirely greener on this side of the fence.

One thing I'm trying to figure out is cross-device play.  I do like that I can move between a few devices and continue playing where I left off.  That was a feature I was yearning for on GooglePlayMusic and YTM.  Now that I have it, it's a mixed blessing.

So how do I do this:   There's a couple of devices that, when I'm playing music on them, I'm 'working' and want it to start on a specific playlist.  The rest of my devices (truck, garage, phone), I want a different playlist.

The problem:
If I finish working in the garage and come in for the night, then sit down in front of my work-computer the next morning and hit 'play', it continues playing 'garage' music instead of 'work' music.  Then I hit play on my 'work' playlist but it starts over, not where it left off the previous morning.

I know, first world problems.",1,925,169

""After canceling the Premium plan, the Spotify service will keep your selections and settings for three months if you change your mind and decide to listen to music on this streaming platform again.  

After 90 days, you can still renew your Premium subscription, but your music library will not be saved and you will have to start collecting track selections again.""

"'Monkey': Weird artist pageThis one's just a weird thing I found on Spotify.

So I was on my homepage and saw the album ""Journey to the West"" as in the 2008 musical by Gorillaz's Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett. I noticed that it was credited under the artist 'Monkey' and out of curiosity, I opened the artist page.

Basically, this artist is supposedly responsible for a wide range of random singles and a few albums spanning totally distinct genres and sounds and is still active to this day. However, the about tab only describes the musical. It's not impossible that this is where Damon Albarn throws his experimental collaborations or something, but the weird thing is the silence and disconnect between any information online.

I suspect Spotify is probably just merging any artist with the name 'Monkey' onto the same page accidentally, but I thought I'd get a few fresh eyes.

Page link: [https://open.spotify.com/artist/2t4lHcyMnvoIm3V0FIzpsi?si=9aoraiyCSW2YkKKrkEps2A](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2t4lHcyMnvoIm3V0FIzpsi?si=9aoraiyCSW2YkKKrkEps2A)",1,1060,154

"Shuffle not workingI don‚Äôt mean it only shuffles the same X amount of songs from an artist; I mean it literally doesn‚Äôt work. 

I go to artist and hit shuffle and it just doesn‚Äôt play anything. I click a song from their top 5 and it only shuffles between those five songs. 

I go to an album and hit shuffle. It chooses one random song and that‚Äôs it. No other songs in the que or before it or anything. If I click a random song then it shuffles the album normally. 

Playlists and going to liked songs and hitting shuffle all work fine. The only fix I‚Äôve found is if I log out, close the app, and log back in, but that fixes it for about two seconds.

"Wondering if you all could help with my Mom's Christmas present...I've been working for weeks I getting my mom's CD she released in 2006 on Spotify and other streaming services. Not for money, just because I think she will think it's really cool. Back in the day she got a ton of these CDs made and still has tons of them in storage and I think it's always made her feel a bit bad.. It finally got up and I'm so excited! I'm wondering if any of you have the time if you wouldn't mind listening to some of the songs or even just playing them in the background of the sound down, so that way when she looks at it on Christmas it will show that there have been some listeners which I think would be really exciting for her!

[Here is a link to her album!](https://open.spotify.com/album/60PjuX2f7FYduU41j1bUiu?si=CUxYHi3PRIiocDxrRCxbGg) I know it won't be most people's tastes, she used to be an opera singer so a lot of it is kind of like that.

"Does Spotify even listent to it's community at this point? We don't even have a proper platform to report bugs #MAKE SPOTIFY GREAT AGAINI think a lot of people can agree with me that our music experience has drastically deteriorated since Spotify introduced us the new UI we basically never asked for. 

I'm not against changes or anything, it's just there are so much ideas coming from the community, but nothing is ever picked up by them. They just do their own thing and make the user experience worse and worse instead of improving it with the community ideas.

There are even like tons of SIMPLE things that are ultimately frustrating and that are still not implemented in Spotify, things like detectinng duplicates, actually show all songs from an artist in your library ( because they don't), searching for specific song meanwhile staying without breaking the shuffle mode, ....    All pretty minor things, but that would make a ocean of change for us users.

I feel like we are treated as shit by Spotify, they just do their own thing all time without taking any considerations of what their users actually want. Updating Spotify feels depressing at this point, updating should be all about improving, right??  The only goal the updates achieve now is pushing people over the edge to Apple Music.",1,1304,222

"Mighty Vibe vs Smart Watch, for offline listening?My dad works in a factory where they are allowed to listen to music over radio/speakers, but are not allowed to have phones or anything resembling a phone, so I'm looking for a dedicated music player that can be paired with his bluetooth speakers, and synced from a streaming app. 

I lean more towards Mighty Vibe because it has much greater storage capacity and supports amazon music, which I already have, whereas on the smart watches I'd have to buy a premium spotify account, but in the end, price is not a factor.

One thing that IS a major factor though, is the ability to be used while connected to a charger, since both the Vibe and the smart watches all seem to have a short battery life, 5 hours or less. If one of them is able to be played while charging, that is the clear winner, and if neither are, then it really comes down to which one charges the quickest so it can be reused again asap, since my dad's shifts are 12 hours long.

I would really love some advice here if you guys are familiar with these products, because I have never used mp3 players or smart watches and really know nothing about them!

"Spotify automatically putting phone's volume setting to maxHi,

I listen to Spotify on my Google Pixel 2 (android 11) with my Sony XM4 bluetooth headphones.


Today I have been experiencing an issue where Spotify will automatically increase my phone's volume to max. If I turn the volume down while a song is playing, a second later it will jump back up to max.

This issue only happens on Spotify. I have used my headphones/phone while using Netflix and Youtube, and they don't have the same problem, it's only Spotify.

I turned off the touch controls on the headphone settings in case that was the issue, but the issue persisted.

I turned off the ""normalize volume"" setting in the Spotify settings, but that didn't work either.

Anyone know why this is happening?",1,767,131
"I will delete my Instagram in favor of SpotifyInstagram is the most useless social network that does not improve the quality of life of people who scroll through the feed by looking at photos of celebrities but only makes you procrastinate and experience the worst feelings - anger, envy, oppression.  
I spend 2 hours a day looking for new music, which I post on Spotify for my friends who follow me, my work for them makes their life better and the day more fun. A large number of people listen to my playlist all day and tell me about it, ask when there will be new tracks there. I get a lot of love from Spotify and I am ready to give a lot of love to those who follow me. Let's communicate by means of love, beauty, and music, and not by means of damn show off, showing everything is fine, but in fact - no.

"What are the 'tiers' of artists based on monthly listeners?For example (this is me making something up, numbers are NOT accurate):

- Tier A: 50million monthly (Drake, Ed Sherran)
- Tier B: 5million monthly (Coldplay, The Beatles, Childish Gambino)
- Tier C: 1million
- Tier D: 500,000 (is this considered mainstream artist? idk if this is 'popular' artist anymore)
- Tier E: 100,000
- Tier F: 20,000

---

The reason is, I'm looking at my artists and I see one that is 400,000 monthly listeners and I assumed they were popular, so i was surprised by this, but idk how to interpret the numbers",1,593,104

"Whenever spotify is running, my phone volume gets pushed to 100%For some reason, whenever I play a song on Spotify after it's been inactive for a little bit, it blasts my volume up to 100%. Just now it's started to glue itself to 100%, even when no song is playing, as long as it's active. Force stopping the app and clearing the cache cleared up this issue for now, but the problem of going to 100% when a song is played after the app has not been used for a bit remains. This is extremely annoying as I blasted with music or sound whenever I play a song.

"¬£4.99 student membership w/ 1 month free or ¬£9.99 individual membership for 3 months free.. Can I choose individual and then just switch after 3 months?I'm currently an Apple Music user, but I want to test out Spotify; I'm mainly charmed by their feature that allows you to see what friends are listening to. A friend tells me that the personalisation &amp; recommendations are above and beyond. 

I am a student, so I can get the 1 month free and ¬£4.99 payment. But I see on the sign up page that the individual plan gives you 3 months free. 

Can I just sign up as an individual for 3 months and if I want to carry on using the service switch to the cheaper student offer? I know there's verification and stuff, that's fine. But I don't want to accidentally lock myself in to paying the higher amount.

"Sound Keeps Cutting In and OutThis has been going on for a few months.¬† Whenever I'm listening to the android app of Spotify, there have been many moments where the sound will just suddenly cut out.¬† It's not muted, volume hasn't changed at all, and yet the timer keeps going.¬† This cut out lasts anywhere between 5 to 15 seconds and then the audio comes back, but it doesn't come back to the point where it cut out, all those muted seconds get missed.¬† So I find myself hitting the back button to go back a few seconds to try and catch those missed moments again, but most of the time, the audio cuts out again and it takes about 5 or more go backs before the audio finally decides to cooperate.¬† Again, this issue began when I first started listening to podcasts a few months ago, but it's present during normal songs as well on the app.¬† I currently am using Google Podcasts to listen to my shows, but I would like to keep using Spotify.

I doubt that this is any kind of connectivity or buffering issue since I always download my podcasts onto my device, yet the issue is still there.

"Can't log in on multiple devices? How to find actual username and not display name?I'm trying to let my younger brother use my Spotify premium account on his cellphone and I've given him my email and password already but it doesn't seem to work for him. Every time he tries to log in, all it does is tell him that it's an incorrect combination of username/email and password and sends me an email with a link to log in that way, even though I've double-checked it and the information is correct. I've read somewhere that the username on your profile is just your display name and your actual username is just random letters and numbers, but I don't know how to find that username.

Does anybody know how to find that random letter and numbers username? Or does anybody know any other workaround?

I read that in order to log in on the same account, you need to be on the same wi-fi network or something which might be hard because I've moved out and no longer live with my family. But he's my younger brother and he isn't able to work, so he doesn't have the means to buy his own premium account, so I don't mind him using mine and want him to be able to use mine, if anybody can help me or solve this issue, it would be much appreciated, thank you!!",1,1250,236

"Random songs being added to liked songs?So I‚Äôm wondering if people have experiences with Spotify adding (and possibly removing) songs that you‚Äôve liked? 

I set my liked songs to shuffle and repeat that playlist. I left my computer, took a shower, and came back and Intro - by The XX had just started playing. Halfway through the song I realized there was a faint voice rapping on it. I listened to this song (and album) a ton in high school and never remembered there really being many lyrics on it. Then I checked the album cover and it wasn‚Äôt the same as the actual album. 

After further inspection, I realized this song was off of a playlist, I think, of a guy who just put vocals over mostly instrumental songs. Never seen or heard of him in my life. Never added that version of the song to my liked songs. I went to check The XX page and apparently Spotify removed all the songs by them that I had added. I added these back around 2015 and don‚Äôt really want to add them because I like the songs and order I have them added currently, but want these older songs to still pop up randomly, which is annoying. 

Anyways, I decided to close Spotify and reopen thinking it maybe glitched or something. I click back on the playlist, set it to shuffle and repeat, and jam out. The very next song is the same one that I removed. It shows that it isn‚Äôt liked and I know for a fact I didn‚Äôt queue it up. 

Idk if this has happened with any other songs I have or if this happens to anybody else, but it‚Äôs pretty strange and annoying. I have no idea why this would happen. I am 100% certain nobody queued/liked it when I walked away or ever really. It also makes no sense for Spotify to play it when it‚Äôs not in the playlist I am listening to.",1,1737,331

"Absolutely loving this gem called Riffbase that lets you save your favourite snippets or riffs from SpotifyHere's a link to access the site [riffbase.net](https://riffbase.net/)  


I found this through [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/riffbase) and credits for developing it goes to [Iury Dias.](https://twitter.com/iurycdias)  


Explaining the tool in his own words  


&gt;As a musician and music-lover, I always found myself listening to specific parts of songs that I really enjoy instead of listening to whole songs. Maybe I like patterns too much, as I mainly listen to progressive rock/metal and math-rock, or maybe I want to learn how to play a certain part of a song, or maybe I just want to listen to that particular, awesome, unforgettable riff over and over again because it's just that good ü§©    
  
&gt;  
&gt;I didn't manage to find a tool that enabled me to save riffs from songs to be able to have a collection of them so I can listen to any of them whenever I want, so I decided to build one, and this is how Riffbase was born ‚ú®    
  
&gt;  
&gt;This is only the beginning. I have many features lined up to be built over the next months, but I wanted to share the first version already with the community so I can iterate faster on feedback, which is always welcome by the way üôè  Thanks a lot and happy riffing!",1,1348,226

"Importing Local Files on AndroidHello! I have an album on my Android phone's SD card that is unavailable on Spotify - is there any way to listen this album via the Spotify app, ideally adding songs from it to other playlists? I have been able to do this on Windows, but I have not been able to listen to those songs on my phone (and even if I could, I have heard that that only works when your phone and computer are on the same WiFi network, which is not ideal). Is there any way to directly add them from phone storage?",1,521,102
"""Song Radio"" only plays songs that I have previously ""Liked"", and not new music anymore?Hello,

I've noticed a change in spotify's 'Song radio' functionality. In the past I would use that all the time to find new music and listen to new stuff. But recently it seems like almost any song radio I go to will HEAVILY favor putting on music that I have already listened to a lot, and in most cases have already saved. 

I feel like I've been exposed to less new music as a result of this, and IMO my favorite thing about spotify in the past has been how good it is at reccomending new music to listen to. 

Has anyone else noticed this?",1,632,119

"My Spotify keeps playing random songs instead of my playlist.For the past day or so, I'll be listening to my Spotify playlist on my laptop and it will cut off mid song to play a song I've never heard before. When I again click on the playlist, the audio will be set to Fire Fox web player even though I don't have Firefox. 

This happens even when I'm not listening to Spotify and just have the application open. It'll just be on chrome and it will start playing a song I've never heard before. I tried deleting the app and re-downloading it, but that hasn't done anything. 

I thought my account might've been exposed, so I changed the password and resigned in but that hasn't done anything either.

"EDM playlist/tips with musically/tonally/rhythmically interesting music? Really getting sick of Pop edm.Its hard to find unique music. Im new to spotify and the radio stations just feed me pop edm, and it sucks. I cant find any music that really HITS, just annoying simple pop stuff. As someone with a lifetime in music and 7+ years producting music, I reallu enjoy music that pushes at boundaries, which often is in prog metal and not in edm.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, Im just looking for ways to find more music I like. Heres a quick playlist that shows some of the simpler side of music that at least doesnt have that ""pop"" feeling 

&amp;#x200B;

[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/41lcwKmgxcd6Sg8g5JnYPj?si=DsoTdypTRsuKmBznFSlicw](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/41lcwKmgxcd6Sg8g5JnYPj?si=DsoTdypTRsuKmBznFSlicw)

&amp;#x200B;

Ideally, Im looking for music that experiments a bit more diversity in tempo/time signature/chord progressions/etc - but these songs at least dont feel annoying to listen to. Nero and Lorn are good examples of tonally interesting music as well.

"Apple Music user trying Spotify. Maybe I‚Äôm missing something but finding my downloaded music is way more annoying than AMOkay so I‚Äôm trying out the 3 month free trial with Spotify to see if I like it over Apple Music. I‚Äôve been with Apple Music since it launched and I‚Äôve never had Spotify.

So as of right now I‚Äôm not a fan of the UI and how they organize my music. On Apple Music I click Artists and it brings me to a list of Artists that I‚Äôve only downloaded songs to my phone of. Then I click on that artist and it shows only the music I‚Äôve downloaded from the artist. 

As far as I‚Äôm aware that‚Äôs not possible with Spotify. The Artist section in library takes you directly to that artists personal music page where you see everything from singles to albums. Apple Music has artist pages but you have to search for them in the search engine. 

I‚Äôm not a fan of the way Spotify handles this. The way I search or music is by going to MY personal library and then going to the Artist and seeing the stuff I‚Äôve downloaded. I‚Äôm not a fan of being forced to see the artists page and then have to go and find what I‚Äôm looking for through there whole discography. You can scroll over to the albums tab and filter downloaded music only, but that only displays albums alphabetically and doesn‚Äôt break it up into artists so if you have a lot of albums, it‚Äôs a lot of scrolling and requires more work.

In other words unless I‚Äôm missing a feature, Apple kills Spotify in UI and over all ease of finding MY music. So Spotify peeps, tell me if I‚Äôm missing something here. Am I not finding a feature or is this just how Spotify is?",1,1620,309

"Spotify Wrapped Stats Seem Completely OffI was very excited to check my stats for this year's Spotify wrapped. I was quite annoyed to know I couldn't get the report on my laptop but that was the least of my worries after a few minutes. As I started to swipe through the wrap on my phone I noticed how much the information displayed seemed off. Many of the artists and songs shown as my ""favorites"" were just songs/artists I had listened to a couple of times and couldn't associate with what so ever and I knew I had not listened to nearly as much as others. Additionally, I saw my minutes listened was at a mere ten thousand which was a mere third of what my brother had listened to and we listen practically the same amount. After a little investigation on [statsforspotify.com](https://statsforspotify.com) I found that it said my stats were way further off what Spotify had told me. It said my most listened to artists and songs were just what I thought they would be. The reason I trust this site is that under the recently played tab it shows the exact 50 most recent songs I've listened to and I can confirm they are right. This leads me to believe that statsforspotify has much more accurate stats and knowledge of my Spotify account. I could be completely wrong I just want to know if anyone else feels the same. Sorry for my little rant, I'm just a bit annoyed and confused.

"I like Spotify but it is also the most frustrating service I subscribe to.Spotify I think easily has the best algorithm of any music streaming service for music discovery and personalized curated playlists in the daily mixes. For that reason I prefer Spotify to Apple Music. 

Spotify pretty much sucks in every other aspect but it‚Äôs that good algorithm and also seeing my wrapped that keeps me in. However wrapped was noticeably worse this year and was a dumb stories style thing that I couldn‚Äôt even view on desktop. 

They are quick to attack Apple for crying out for being anti competitive but then turn around and drag their feet to improve their product on Apple devices. 

-Apple Watch app took years to come out and doesn‚Äôt cache songs for offline listening for workouts and honestly barely functions in my experience. 

-No support for Airplay 2 after over a year and a half. Ridiculous for an iOS app at this point. 

-No HomePod support, not even announced. This is huge as with HomePod mini I might pick up a few and get Apple Music and never look back to Spotify. This is their own fault, Apple has opened the API to third parties Pandora works and Amazon announced they‚Äôre working on an integration. For Amazon, HomePod is their direct competitor to their smart speakers!!

-No MFA. It‚Äôs 2020, that‚Äôs embarrassing. Any online account should have some basic form of MFA. Most services are moving away from SMS because it‚Äôs not secure enough. Spotify out here like it‚Äôs still 2009 and MFA isn‚Äôt a thing. 

-No word yet for a macOS app compiled for Apple silicon. 

I am trying Apple Music again but that sweet sweet algorithm keeps me coming back to Spotify. But I don‚Äôt know if can do it for much longer because I‚Äôm getting annoyed as a consumer that they‚Äôre not stepping up to improve the experience.",1,1814,319

Since I did it more than 50 times this year and it takes around 2 hours, if it doesn't count, I lost more than 6000 minutes of listening time on my wrapped.

"Dealing with old mp3sHi everybody.
I‚Äôm a long time iTunes user. This means that not only I have more than 2500 saved songs in my library, but I also have more than 900 mp3s (songs that are not available on any music catalogue) that I carefully downloaded and compiled with the correct metadata over the course of more than 13 years.

As you might‚Äôve guessed by now, I‚Äôm pretty attached to my music library. Making the switch to Apple Music a couple of years ago was a big sacrifice for me, but I knew that streaming services were here to stay and storing songs in a library was soon going to become obsolete.

So for the last 3 years I tried to keep my music library going (Apple Music allows me to upload mp3s to the cloud), while trying to embrace the whole streaming service experience.
Lately though, I started to realize how much more optimized the Spotify user experience is: suggestion algorhytms are arguably better, curated playlist are updated more frequently and in general the social features such as Wrapped 2020 are much more compelling.

With that said, is there anybody who, like me, left its own music library behind to pursue a more modern listening experience? If yes, do you miss your old music library or perhaps suggest I do the same?

Thanks!",1,1265,225

""Erika Marol""

Now no disrespect to this artist if in fact they are a real artist, but I don't think it is. All their songs have hundreds of thousands of streams on Spotify, but when I google the name I see basically nothing besides a YouTube page (with &lt;100 plays on each track). There are a couple reddit threads with others mentioning that their Spotify was playing this artist's tracks. If I had to guess, this is a fake artist page owned by hackers (or at least partnering with hackers), which is used to monetize stolen accounts though per stream fees. 

Sometime earlier this year I did find out from either Google or Apple that my Spotify credentials had been compromised and I did change my password to a strong, generated password (and logged out all locations). I've requested my data from Spotify to verify when it occurred, and to make my own wrapup. Also the fact that Spotify still doesn't have 2FA is a travesty.

"Questions about Spotify Premium for FamilyHeya everyone, hope you're all doing well. Just wanted to ask a few questions regarding the Spotify Premium for Family subscription.

* Do I need to add all 5 sub-accounts upon the time of activating for the master account or can I take as long as I want and just add them whenever I want?
* My boyfriend lives with me and I want to add him to the Family plan, but he's already subscribed to a 1-year Individual Premium plan. Does he need to cancel his subscription before I can add him? Can I add him without breaking his own plan? What happens to his plan? Does he get refunded for his remaining months (he subscribed October 2020)?
* We're using my boyfriend's billing information for this new plan which I'm sure isn't an issue with Spotify. Or am I wrong?
* In the future, am I able to remove members that I added as sub-accounts and replace them with other accounts? Are there special rules for this?

Create a free account and link it to your spotify to see what artists, albums and tracks you have listened to in configurable dates.

"My university isn‚Äôt on the list when signing up for the student planI‚Äôm in Canada and realized today when trying to sign up for the student plan that my university isn‚Äôt on the list of universities.

Did some research and found there was a form to fill out as a request to get other universities added onto the list, so I filled out that form. Noticed there could be a wait time of about a week before hearing back as well.

Has any other students tried filling out this form, and what were the results? How long did it take for you to hear back and did you get your university added to the list?

Am I out of luck if thjs doesn‚Äôt work? Is there any other way to get my university added?",1,687,134

like others mentioned before, most of the songs in my Spotify playlist are just a song that I cycled for like a whole day and never listen to it ever again. and one of the songs is just like that but somehow it got to the top 20. and another song that I have been listening to for the whole year just got rank 76.   
I've also heard people say that Spotify only start to collect data after Oct.31. I think that is true and extremely irresponsible. my top 1 song of the year is a song that I only cycled from Nov.1st to Nov.10th. never heard of it until November. So I think the theory is definitely true.

Even then you‚Äôll get a vague list of most played songs and artists, but it doesn‚Äôt say how many times you played the songs, how many times you listened to the artist, etc.

How hard would it be to give you ALL the info of your listening habits? Is it that hard to track? Why is it only accessible once a year, through a website? Why not directly on the app, any time you like? It‚Äôs so frustrating... seems like a no-brainer feature. Am I missing something?",1,959,173

\-No comments: people want to comment, interact, feel important. You are loosing billions of lines of text that will be indexed by search engines, cross links which pump up Page rank, user interactions browser cookies. You are loosing market share.

\-No captions: ""Deaf people? If they can't read lips, they better learn. Not our problem! ""

   ""Want to have the text transcription for journalists, students, amateurs, random text use? not our problem!"" 

   ""Are you a robot, or google scraper, and want to index the text in the podcast speach, to pump up  our views? We don't like more views or be indexed. We LOVE to lose market shares""

 You are loosing market shares.

\- No translation captions: in the AI era, where translated captions ARE TRIVIAL, you cut out that half of the world population which don't speak english, and would like to watch the podcast translated. You are loosing market share. Deaf foreign people, well, really not our problem I know.

\-Missing video speed adjustment: many, many people, listen podcast at 1.25+ speed, they are already commenting it on Youtube: ""We can't do it on spotify!"" ...Spotify: ""Not my problem!"" ...go watch the comments, devs.

\-""Want to stop watching the podcast, and start back from that second, WITHOUT SEARCHIN IT, LIKE EVERY OTHER MAJOR VIDEO PLATFORM IN THE WORLD!? Dude, who do you think we are, magicians!? get out you and your sorcery tricks!""

\-""Want to setup your video quality, because maybe you have poor bandwidth, or go pawa cos you have a 300inch monitor 8K? WE THOUGHT WE WHERE CLEAR THAT THESE ARE NOT OUR PROBLEMS, GET A BETTER PC/CONNECTION, or watch it like poor people on a normal screen, you both loosers.""

\-""Want to have the picture in picture floating video box option, like every other major browser on the market? Who do you think we are, freakin Firefox, dude!?!?""

\-BUFFERING: ""want to use a browser or do some other activity wich require network, like THE MAJORITY OF USERS, whom use the podcast like a side TV show entertaiment doing work? NOT OUR PROBLEM."" Podcast video is constantly buffering, ALSO WITHOUT OTHER BROWSERS, all my firefox tabs goes super laggy, forget to do something else on a browser without super lag and freezing browser/spotify. ""WE OWN the network, give us ALL your bandwith, not our problem if you need it for emails. If u want email, wait for buffering video. Can't pretend to have both, dude.""

\-Devs: ""Please, also don't move or resize the window if you want a smooth video, we managed to make it freeze, glitch and stop playing, everything you do to the window, you are welcome!"".

\-Giant shadow making super dark top and bottom of the screen (basically half of video window), any time the mouse goes over, for seconds. ARE YOU SERIOUS? wtf. 

\-Devs: ""We also managed to use 3 times the RAM amount of every other browser, to give you the worst user experience of every video platform, requiring subscription while the others don't: YOU ARE WELCOME!"". 

Over all, nice job devs: videobox, play, pause. Subscrbe to watch. What they would want more? Well done.

It has accumulated almost 2k streams, while their first track which came out last month has 3.5k streams. That's fair enough, and the music is good. The problem is they only have had 300 monthly listeners, up to 350 now. It's never gone above that so I find the amount of plays on them tracks very odd. That would mean every single listener is listening to the track at least 4 or 5 times in a short space of time which I just find odd. The band isn't on any big playlists, only ones with max 120 followers. Anyone know what's going on here?",1,653,126

"Spotify is a worthless piece of SHIT.Yep, apologies for the somewhat obscene title, but it has to be said. Spotify is complete and utter crap.

Not the content itself mind you, I have little to no problems with that whatsoever, there's more than that for me to go on. The problem I have is the inability for the desktop application (I'm on a Mac for anyone curious) to perform even the simpliest of tasks, like searching up a song or an artist, or simply just accessing the page of an artist or album. Any time I try to do one of those things after a few minutes of use, it just stays on a blank page with fuck-all coming up or (in the case of viewing artist/album pages) stays locked on a spinning reticle endlessly until I click on something else or restart the program just to get it to work.

This thing is about as responsive as a wet dog shit on a rainy night, and that's putting it nicely. It's absolutely fucking pathetic that I'm paying monthly for it when it acts like this, and has been doing for past few years or so. There's no issue with my broadband, or my computer (it acts like this on my other Mac as well), it's just a barely functioning pile of hot garbage, PERIOD.

The challenge is, I am not as musically involved as she is and really want to do something she will enjoy and have fun with.  She is literally into everything from Biggie, to Opera, to Rock, etc.  Her taste is all over the place.  I was hoping you all could make some suggestions on what to add for her!     

She is a Gemini, and self described Empath, Spiritual Healer, and Old Soul.  We are middle aged (35ish) if that matters.  Would really appreciate any help, or direction.

"Imagine this.....(just a thought; long text)Hello earth people, I‚Äôve been thinking, and I have no idea if anyone has ever thought of this, but what if Spotify did a playlist exchange. The playlist exchange would connect every username that has a public playlist and shares it in a database. In order to establish privacy, the person has the ability to set a playlist exchange username, so in the case that their playlist is shared, it can‚Äôt really be linked back to anyone. If you have contacts, you have the ability to add them as a friend with a choice of using your real username. Now onto how it could work, like stated before, Spotify will exchange usernames by location set and usernames with public playlists. Then Spotify will send each username with another person, it could be a friend, a DJ from M√©xico, a doctor from Seattle, or even someone from another place in the world. But, you will not be able to retrieve personal details about this person apart from their username, playlist name, and duration of playlist. I think it would be pretty cool if preferences were added like certain genres, artists, and languages could be filtered in or out depending on a users taste. Tags could also be added to specify the details of the playlist. For example : Languages: English, Spanish, Korean Genre: R&amp;B, Reggaet√≥n, K-Pop could be possible tags. There could also be a feature where you can see how many viewed your playlist, where they are from, and their positive reactions (via liking a song or adding it to their playlist). I think it would be amazing to listen to someone‚Äôs playlist from a different part of the world or even a different part of the country. Spotify let me know üòÇ

"In search of new playlists - synth? - someone please help I don't know how to describe what I'm looking for!Hi spotify reddit people,   
I'm at my wits end trying to expand my exposure to muisc, but I don't know how to find what I'm looking for and the more I listen to my auto-recommended playlists the more narrow these seem to become which is exactly opposite of what I'm trying to do.

I have no idea how to describe what I'm trying to find to work out to but I'll start with this:

\- Depeche mode is handsdown my favourite band esp songs like In Your Room, Stripped, Policy of Truth.  
\- Blaqk audio is okaayyy i guess but a little too cheesy I can't take it seriously  
\- Chvrches. love them but sometimes gets too girly that it bumps me out of my zone  
\- Goldfrapp and Dave Gahn (of depeche mode) do a song called ocean that I'm LOVING  
\- Halsey strange love is a current fave though will never match DM's strange love haha (not that it's trying to these are very different songs)  
\- I took a pill in Ibiza, Wake me up, Mi Gente, Arty Remix Halsey Hurricane all get me going  
\- but HATE so much other top 40: Beibers too whiny, Pitbull's too worldwide, katy perry too boppy etc  
\- however I somehow really love wolves/bad liar/good for you selena gomez and some cardi b  
\- I'm always looking for nightclub/party playlists but they all sound too... dance trance and dreamy  
\- AM by Arctic monkeys is one of my favourite albums EVER  
\- Love Twilight sad (scottish band nothing to do with twilight the book)  
\- Bat for lashes, and Die Antword also good.  


I dunno if any of you have made playslists that fall somehow in this weird space between nighclub?  and dark?-synth. (I'm clearly not confident in identifying genres). Or if you can recommend any genres I might be able to search? any help would be SO appreciated!",1,1846,339
"Browsing albums. Did something change?I noticed recently that I haven't been seeing many albums. I always thought Spotify was pretty balanced with its content with a mix of albums, songs, and playlists with a bias that leans more toward playlists. Now if I browse around, all I see are playlists and new releases. Here's an example - 

Old navigation and results - 
* Go to search
* Click on category like ""rock""
* This takes me to a page that has rock playlists, rock albums I might be interested in, new rock albums, and rock albums by subcategory (like classic rock with various classic rock albums and playlists).

New navigation
* Go to search
* Click on a category like ""rock""
* Go to a screen that has nothing but rock playlists and new releases. That's it.

What happened? I mean I don't expect Apple Music levels of bias toward albums, but I can't really find anything outside of playlists anymore.",1,907,161

"Daily mix isueI've basically have been using Spotify sine I was 7 turning 21 in two days so over a decade. During whitch my musical taste has been changing quite a lot from 90's hip hop to dubsteb , but for about 7-8 years Ive been getting more and more into rock and then into metal and some funk /jazz soul and classical.

The problem arrises that I used to like absolutely every album of any musician that I just slightly liked , so my liked playlist is absolute crap with well over 1000 songs, that most of them I cant even stand. But the daily mix seems to be based on the liked songs rather than what you tend to be listening in the past months, is there a way to switch that , because out of the 6 daily mix playlists 3 tend to be of music I havent liked in +-7 years.

TL:DR:  some of the daily mix playlists seem to be based on the liked songs rather than most listened to, long time user so that liked playlist is crap and too long to delete one by one by a two button process. Is there a way to make daily mix be based only on listened songs?",1,1053,211

Before lyrics match this was an effective way of finding all the songs with a specific title. That is no longer the case because now the results put more popular songs with a different title (and a lyrics match) over less popular songs with the same title.

Example: Cruel to Be Kind

The [Shonen Knife cover](https://open.spotify.com/track/2v25Gg18jgdHkXGQYEDHjZ?si=pYogc4sYTgq5EDLtikl4Uw) with the same title is number 244 in the results after many other songs that have no relationship to the song titled ‚ÄúCruel to Be Kind.‚Äù

This is a gigantic pain in the ass if you have thousands of songs and hundreds of playlists. At the very least just add a download all button or something because downloading on the PC app and the Spotify app is stupid and unintuitive because you have to go into each individual playlist to hit the download button which is ridiculous. The previous app version allowed you to select a download button as your scrolling through your playlist, who thought it was a good idea to remove that feature??

In the meantime, if anyone is having a similar issue with their playlist getting deleted, round about solution is to make a playlist and add all your songs to that playlist and just hit the download button for that one playlist instead of individually going to your other playlist.

"Is there anyway to 'fix' odd picks in Daily Mix playlists?I've been using Spotify for a long bloody time, easily over 10 years, and as a result its pretty damn good at knowing my tastes.  
  
But it keeps doing something really odd with one of my daily mixes and I want to know if I can fix it. Theres a regular mix I get of metalcore type tracks, but over the past few weeks Spotify has been *consistentpy* putting City &amp; Colour in there which is easy going acoustic.  
  
Now, I do like a bit of City &amp; Colour (but a bigger fan of Dallas' other project Alexisonfire) but its really jarring having easy going acoustic country sounds sandwiched between metal tracks, not exactly the driving or gym jams I'm looking for.

"any Media Monkey and Spotify users out there?I'm new to spotify. I know I might be the last person on earth to try streaming music. And generally my experience over the last month is that I loathe it, but see no other way to passively discover new music in 2020.

I'm one of these old school people that began building my digital music library in the 90s. I used winamp for a long while and switched to media monkey around 2005. Over 20+ years I have collected lots of music but more importantly LOTS of data about my music library. Playcounts, skips, playlists, ratings, custom scripts and algorithms that create ratings and other systems to rank music.

When I switch to spotify it's like giving up a tried and true customized dream vehicle for a Fischer price steering wheel toy. Spotify lacks so much, there's no ratings, no easily accessible data like play counts. Not even a simple EQ. Have I really become ""old man yells at cloud"" here? Help me!!

**MM to spotify&gt;** I found a round about method to import a top 500 playlist into spotify through 3rd party services so spotify would at least get some indication of my preferences. It was about 70% accurate at song recognition. I went through and liked everything in there, followed lots of artists. It allowed spotify to generate some playlists to my tastes, but they mostly contain the music I just injected via playlist and not much new.

**Spotify to MM&gt;** The dream would be to have some kind of integration, where playcounts on spotify could be linked or exported to include in my Media Monkey database. Or alternatively, how wonderful would that be to have an API to stream music directly from within Media Monkey so it can keep track of plays ratings etc, and use virtual links to spotify in lieu of mp3 files.

Some people have suggested use of last.fm scrobbling. Media Monkey has some integration with last.fm too. it's a thought to explore.

tl;dr I'm old and set in my ways with using media monkey and won't be throwing away a near lifetime of data and tools to convert to being a spotify user. Who out there is a dinosaur like myself? What do you do to find new music?",1,2144,384

"Spotify is forcing folks to beta test a new Desktop UI with no way to opt-out. Would you please help us fight back?!Spotify is forcing a subset of their users to Beta their new Desktop UI as phase 2 of testing it. Phase 1 was testing it with their 'Rockstar' users (I do not know if Rockstar users opt-in to that or what). Phase 0 was internal.

&amp;#x200B;

I woke up to the Beta Desktop UI a few days ago. I am livid.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Why this forced Beta is wrong in a shortlist\*\*\*

\*\*1) It's disrespectful to paying customers to turn them into your lab rats.\*\*

Exaggerated example - Imagine if the Government came up and grabbed you, a taxpaying citizen, and said 'You will be testing our new Covid vaccine. You have no choice. We do not care."" and pricked you in the arm. There would be rioting in the streets. Let's interpolate that back to this less severe situation and realize what Spotify is doing is wrong. It might not be murder or torture or forced medical practices, but it is wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*2) Participants aren't helpful because they didn't want to be participants.\*\*

 There is a clear difference from the very very few folks who are OK with unwillingly being part of the Beta. Those folks have tended to dislike the changes, but offer proper feedback without the rage and disgust of being forced into the group. This feedback is infinitely more useful than the angry folks going 'I didn't want this and it sucks'.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*3) There is no way to opt-out.\*\* 

Hell, there was no way to opt-in. I would be maybe cool with it if they forced the beta but gave me a way to switch out and they told me why they put me in the group. Like 'Hey, you have used our software for 10 years on Xbox, Desktop, and mobile and we value your opinion the most. Please test this out, but you may opt-out at any time'. The disrespect of forcing it would be negated by my Ego saying 'Cool, they value my opinion as a longtime subscriber'. And I do understand that at some point it is very valuable to get the opinion of folks who didn't want to test the new design. But you must let them get out of it if they do not want to.

But, I know nothing besides the fact I have paid them for almost a decade and they never asked me to help them like this and I cannot opt-out and they have not told me why I am a part of this group.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*4) Functionality is cut or broken all over the place\*\*

The update is bad. It broke so much and offered basically no new neat features. It's a mobilification of what should be a Desktop experience. I think there is literally nothing new. It's just different and worse. One person was dragging a folder they have and a bug caused the folder to absorb everything it dragged over. Yup, all their lists are totally messed up and they ever asked for that. Time to spend who knows how long fixing that up. If I did that, I have enough playlists it would take me some time to fix it. Want to sort by Artist? There is no column for artists anymore. It is gone. You have to triple-click the Title column.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*5) The Spotify team has not updated us in over a week\*\*

They updated us once on the 19th to say ""We are gonna fix like 3 of the bugs"". That is all. There are now over 40 pages of feedback(almost exclusively negative).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*TLDR - Spotify is forcing users to Beta their stuff and beyond that horribleness is the fact the update is terrible and you cannot opt-out and they have not responded with a proper update in over a week.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Please can you all give your two cents about what they are doing in their forum for feedback?

[https://community.spotify.com/t5/Desktop-Windows/New-Desktop-Experience-your-feedback-wanted/td-p/5072418](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Desktop-Windows/New-Desktop-Experience-your-feedback-wanted/td-p/5072418)

It is filled with negative feedback and the Spotify team is hiding. We need the Spotify community's help to stand up and say ""1) This is wrong. 2) We do not approve of this. 3) Continued behavior like this will result in us leaving the service"".

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all and let's hope the Spotify team sees the error in their ways so we can all enjoy our 2020 wrapped data without bitterness next week.",1,4294,752

"Script to roll back latest update on Windows PC.The [""new desktop experience""](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Desktop-Windows/New-Desktop-Experience-your-feedback-wanted/td-p/5072418/page/31) is garbage and has broken several features, such as the ability to hide/dislike songs.

Copy the script below, paste it into notepad, and Save As &gt; ""Spotify_Rollback.cmd""

However, my MacBook is showing me all 152 songs. The folder is synced using Google Drive so they are the exact same files.

"How did shuffle get worse with the 8.5.80.1037 update for android (non-premium account)?Don't mind the flair...this is more of an honest question than a complaint, the flair was just oddly specific and there may be some complaining involved in here.

Before I updated, shuffle pretty much did what it was suppose to. The only thing was, it rearranged playlists in a shuffled order and proceeded to play that list in a shuffled order instead of going top to bottom. It was super shuffled! Any song that played was stricken from the list which was great...no repeats and it finished when it was done.  Fast forward to the aforementioned update and shuffle no longer rearranges the songs list-wise while also not removing songs that already played. How is this an improvement? I thought it was bad when a 500+ song playlist played two or three songs back to back from the same album from the same artist, now it can presumably do that multiple times before I can finish out the list.

like this you could sell your game and giving the player a choice to integrate their own account with the game so they could listen to the music they already listen to but in the game. while you could select some special playlists for radios

&amp;#x200B;

like this, if players want to use this feature they have to renew their Spotify premium or buy fresh, that would be profitable for Spotify",1,526,92
"Release radar is driving me CRAZY!Recently every time I check out my release radar the cover of the playlist will be for a song that is not included, however it is a song from one of my followed artists and I can only find it if I 1. go through each of my followed artists or 2. the song happens to have the title in the image.

Just wondering if this is happening to anyone else or if my account is cursed :)

"anyone looking for new spotify mixes? (If you comment a genre, vibe, or anything you're looking for, I'll point you in the direction of the mix(es) I think is(are) best suited for you :))Essentially, I've got a hobby for curating all sorts of playlists which I use everyday. One of my buddies recently switched from apple music to spotify, just to have access to these mixes, so I figured I'd repost them again here \^\^

"where can I find a playlist including the music from the game 'world of goo'?So lately  I have been  playing the game world of goo (which I highly recommend!), and I thought that the music in this game so well done  that I directly went to spotify to search it up.

"Android Spotify Unresponsive/Controls Very Delayed??Hi, running on a Google Pixel 5, previously on the Pixel 3.

About August-ish, Spotify was running just fine on my Pixel 3 with no issues at all. I was separated from my phone all the way up until October 30th, when I got it back. Once I had updated all my shit, Spotify began running kind of slow. 
Then, I switched phones, did all that cool jazz, and even after reinstalling about 5 times, deleting everything that says Spotify, and so on, the app still runs super slow, it takes like 20 seconds for me to pause songs, in fact all buttons/controls are extremely delayed.

I also have Spotify on my laptop, and it sometimes has issues with control delays and whatnot.

What's going on? Anyone got a fix?",1,756,134

"Desktop App Update; Sorting playlist issue SolvedI have no idea when this update happened, I'm assuming in the past week or so. my spotify desktop app updated to this new version (1.1.46.916.g416cacf1-a ) and it changed how my playlist was sorted.

It was originally listed as #| Title | Album | Date | \*clock icon\* 

i like sorting my playlist by artist, it's much easier for me. I was coming on here originally to ask if anyone knew how to fix this, but i figured it out and want to pass my knowledge to anyone who may not know of this. If you wish to sort your playlist by artist, you will have to click on the Title section of the toolbar three or four times, depending on preference if you want the artist names to be alphabetized from A-Z or Z-A.

Hope this helps anyone!",1,779,146
"More useful features removed.Another month, another Spotify update that removes functionality. On the PC desktop app specifically, I once could click an artists name in my Artist's Collection page, and it would show me all the thumbed tracks from that artist. I used this all the time, and now these links just take you to the artist's page. I can't fine a way to view all thumbed tracks from a single artist, other than searching through my Liked Songs playlist, which also doesn't work. If I search for Roots Manuva, no results come up, but when I search for Roots, all his stuff, as well as a few other songs called Roots, come [up.](https://up.So) Searching the whole name should definitely work. Also with searching, I searched Dirty, the title of a song and it found around 6 results in my playlist, but when I clicked Play on the track, it queued up all 6 results to play, rather than just start playing that playlist, from the song I selected as it used to. Also, it used to be when you used the navigation arrows at the top, your place on a given playlist would be saved, now it's not. Now if I'm looking through a playlist, and click someone's name, it takes me to their page as it should, but then it resets where i was scrolling when i use the back arrow. It didn't behave this way before. We also lost the ability to see our whole queue. Now it only shows the next 30 or so. I can't drag things up a list anymore. If you had songs queued and added another that you wanted to put NEXT in queue, you could add it to queue, then drag it to the top of the list. Now I can't drag things. I can move them up like 10 spaces, as many as fit on the screen at once, but I cannot drag them and hold at the top to make the list scroll.   


I don't know why Spotify likes removing features, but a quick look through this sub's posts tells me it's nothing new.

"I have a suggestion in mind..Picture this.. You're listening to a song you like from one of your curated playlists and suddenly you remember a similar song you'd like to listen to next. You search the song but the only way to listen to it next is adding it to that playlist and upping it the queue. 

Now, instead of this imagine there's a feature that allows you to play that particular song next, and takes you back into the loop for your curated playlist (and plays the next song in your playlist automatically without pressing too many buttons). 

This way you listen to that song one time without having to add in the playlist.

"Spotify randomly undownloading my playlists for no reason?My mobile Spotify has been acting rly weird lately. First it made all my custom songs unavailable and now it undownloaded my 3k + song playlist (not just custom songs) . Its so fkn frustrating. Why does this happen? 
Weirdly enough, some of my custom songs remained downloaded. Did Spotify enforce a new policy that deletes ‚Äûcopyrighted‚Äú songs even if they‚Äôre locally added? Almost all my custom travis scott songs that aren‚Äôt on Spotify were undownloaded. I also cannot listen to them either. It works fine on pc tho.

"Spotify skipping songs in a playlist doesn't workI have the new update for desktop Spotify which is bad enough as is but now when listening to a song in a playlist if I choose to press the skip button it's just skipping through songs in a different playlist.

Example

I'm playing Song 3 (S3) in Playlist 1(P1). If I skip it should play S4 in P1 but it'll play S1 in P6. If I manually choose S4 in P1 then press skip again it will play S2 in P6. If is go back to P1 and skip it'll go to S3 in P6 essentially playing through all of P6 in order when I'm trying to listen to P1.

So when skipping it starts playing songs in a different playlist but goes through them in order.

I hope I'm making sense. Its incredibly annoying",1,723,143

Spotify needs a new podcast systemI‚Äôve been getting into a lot of podcasts lately. I like listening to recent episodes but I don‚Äôt like how I have to go into my podcasts every day and download more. If there was a playlist that downloaded the most recent episode on each of my followed podcasts that would be sweet. I‚Äôve tried making podcasts playlists but then I stIll have to add it to the playlist and then find it once I‚Äôm done and delete it. Kind of a weird system right now. I‚Äôve also tried playlists made by Spotify but I prefer listening to podcasts I follow and My Daily Podcasts sucks. Mine only has two episodes from podcasts I follow and the rest are random suggestions. I hope it improves and is more automated in the future.,1,738,137

Spotify is crashing random apps that I open and it crashes itself sometimes. It happens on my iPhone 7 and my 7 Plus which has more ram.",1,356,66
"Made the switch from Apple Music. Why I did it.I made the switch to Spotify until Apple redesigns Music from the ground up. Apple Music is probably the most buggy app I have ever used. 
I really want to keep using Apple Music. I have been with it since it‚Äôs release and I came from Beats Music.

&gt; Apple Music feels way too heavy. It‚Äôs hard to explain but you have to use it for some time and then switch to Spotify to understand what I mean. It‚Äôs slow when loading playlists, music, the app, a page, anything. It‚Äôs too damn slow.

&gt; I decided to go against the nature of Apple Music (focus on library, and less on playlists) by focusing primarily on playlists. I dumped the idea of building a library because I most likely remember most of the music I like, stopped using the iCloud music library upload, and put the music I dont listen to often in a playlist. Anyways, the iCloud music library has a knack of replacing songs that aren‚Äôt available on Apple Music anymore with another version of the song somewhere else. 
	You might think, ‚ÄúReally, you bitching about that?‚Äù Yes. Let‚Äôs say you have a Beatles album, Rubber Soul to be exact. Michelle isn‚Äôt available on the Rubber Soul album anymore because the studio removed it for some unknown reason. Apple, instead of graying the song out and telling you that its no longer available (which i prefer) instead finds it in some compilation called ‚ÄúSongs of the 60‚Äôs‚Äù adds it into your library, doesn‚Äôt include it in the Beatles artists page, and yeah it doesn‚Äôt even tell you its removed from rubber soul. No gray out, no notification, most of the time it doesn‚Äôt even appear in your recently added. Oh and if the song does come back to the album, it wont replace it. This is annoying when you have over 9,000 songs in your library. 
	Now I deleted my whole library and focused on playlists. The playlists aren‚Äôt any better. Changing playlist pictures on Spotify updates it on every single device you are signed in on right away. Apple sometimes never does it. I had to update a few playlist covers right. None of them changed on my iPhone, or iPad. Just on the Mac. When i went to the social network page where you can see your shared playlists, it still showed the old covers. When I tried to stop sharing the playlist, the done option was grayed out. I was so damn confused. It literally wouldn‚Äôt let me share or stop sharing playlists because of a playlist cover or something. I don‚Äôt know. Like i said, its buggy.

There are some other things i do not like about Apple like how it handles its radio tab, the algorithm for music, and the heavy focus on popular genres and lack of playlists on some other ones (blues). 

Spotify isn‚Äôt all perfect. No radio for example and honestly, sometimes i can do without the dark mode. Oh and when looking for albums, i dont want to see:

- Sgt. Peppers
- Sgt. Peppers (Remastered)
- Sgt. Peppers (Deluxe edition)
- Sgt. Peppers (super deluxe edition)

Just show me the latest release or something. Apple has it so it shows i believe the latest and then at the bottom they show different versions. It is less cluttered.",1,3119,567

So, should I watch it? For the reference, I enjoyed Sherlock (S1 &amp; S2) and the suspension of disbelief in it is acceptable. But the Now You See Me has some way to over the top plans that I am not okay with (it has the same director as that of the Lupin, if that means anything).",0,579,107

"(USA) Does Netflix have the CGI (Blu Ray) version of AOT?
I just found out that AOT has 2 versions being the TV format (2D) or the Blu Ray format (CGI/3D) of Season 1. But... does this apply to all seasons or just Season 1? Anyhoo... does Netflix have the Blu Ray version and if not, what sources do provide it?

"Solution to Netflix Error tvq-pb-101 (5.2.5): Remove Audio Interface?I bought a new Sony 55XBR900H in September and I very quickly started having issues with the netflix app. I kept on getting the same error: tvq-pb-101 (5.2.5). Some titles would work (e.g. Being John Malkovich) and some wouldn't (e.g. Real Steel)  


I tried resetting everything, I tried new accounts. Netflix support told me nothing useful. Sony support was helpful but couldn't fix my issue. Everyone insisted it was my network despite having no issues on any other kind of content, since they noticed that newer 4K titles weren't working but older HD titles were. So I bought a powerline adapter to test that theory.  


Of course, with my luck, now HD titles weren't working either.   


BUT! In my experimenting, I noticed that the titles that weren't playing were titles with 5.1 surround or Atmos sound encoding. I've been running my sound via USB to a Behringer UMC202HD and KRK Rokit 5G3 studio monitors; When I got rid of the audio interface, everything worked fine on the TV's built-in speakers. When I connected my speakers directly to the TV through a 3.5mm to RCA cable, everything still works.   


I'm not sure whether it's Netflix's fault, or the TV's fault, or the audio interface's fault; I'm just happy my TV is working again.

"Netflix need the option to customize subtitlesI've recently been watching a lot of foreign language movies by changing my location to other countries.

I often rent movies on youtube if i can't find them anywhere else. YouTube gives you the possibility to edit the subtitles, i prefer them as small as possible and transparent (possibly yellow if the movie is  black and white).

"How to stop movies and TV shows from playing upon selectionWhen selecting movies or TV shows, I would like some time to learn more about them before choosing to start watching them.

I've turned off autoplay while browsing (where it automatically shows trailers for titles you've highlighted) and autoplay next episode (where it automatically plays the next episode in the series).

This is a different kind of autoplay that there does not seem to be a setting for. 

In essence, what I'm trying to do is spend time on a title's detail page without having to stop the title from playing then hit the return button to go back to the detail page, so I can read the summary and navigate the other details without being distracted by a title I'm not ready to start watching.

In the series Cobra Kai we are seeing groups of people starting to team-up and form alliances.

I think it would be cool, not to say it needs to happen in the next season, but more so in the overall series. If Daniel, Johnny &amp; Julie would form to help the students at Miyagi-Do/Eagle Fang (Probably more so Miyagi-Kai) in their battle against John Kreeses new Cobra Kai.

I think Julie will make an appearance probably by visiting Mr.Miyagis grave and bumping into Daniel. Maybe she comes at a time where Sam is in need of more a female role model that she can connect with.

As for Silver we potentially already know that he‚Äôs returning for Season 4 as Kreese quite possibly got off the phone to him. As for Barnes, well I haven't thought that one through. Maybe Silver and Kreese bail him out of jail and have him wrapped around their fingers.

"1440p HDR and 4K HDR Netflix on Windows 10I thought I'd make a useful post about getting Netflix working in 4K (3840\*2160) and 1440p (2560\*1440) resolution. I decided to make this after countless posts and Netflix' own website being somewhat useless when it comes to key details, as well as a fix I found from another user. There are also countless posts saying 1440p is not a supported resolution, which is simply not true. 

For those of you on an NVIDIA GPU, (I'm unsure of the AMD process, or onboard graphics), you can also use DSR or simply modify to a 4K resolution for 4K content.

1440p: [https://imgur.com/rWVJNR2](https://imgur.com/rWVJNR2) 

You can use Ctrl+Shift+Alt+D to bring up the bitrate menu.

Here are the Netflix requirements, **but I've amended them so you can see what actually works:**

""Netflix is available in Ultra HD on Windows computers and tablets. To stream in Ultra HD, you will need:

* *A Windows 10 computer or tablet with the latest Windows updates installed.* **This is version 20H2.**
* *The Microsoft Edge browser or the Netflix app for Windows 10.* **The Netflix app for me is hit or miss, sometimes HDR = true and sometimes it doesn't work at all. For me, the consistent experience has always been with Microsoft Edge.**
* *A 60Hz 4K capable display (with* ***HDCP 2.2*** *connection if external display).*   
***NOTE:*** ***Every monitor*** *connected to your computer must meet these requirements to successfully stream in Ultra HD.* **Unfortunately, Netflix doesn't go far enough here. Not only do you need to be HDCP 2.2 compliant on EVERY display, it also needs to be over HDMI, at least on the first instance. You must be thinking, what? What I mean by this is, DisplayPort didn't work until I unplugged all devices and used HDMI. For some reason, then switching back to DP ONLY works. (Thanks to another Reddit user for highlighting this weird fix.) I sat for hours having met every requirement wondering why it wouldn't work, until I tried this.** ***NOTE 2: The same Reddit user confirmed his display was not HDCP 2.2 compliant with the manufacturer (LG), yet this fix still worked. Just use Windows key + p to switch to main display only if your second display is causing the issue. I disable my other one so you should try and see if it works for you, your mileage may vary...***
* *Intel's 7th generation Core CPU (i3, i5, or i7 models in the 7xxx or 7Yxx series) or newer,* ***or*** *a NVIDIA GPU that meets* [*these requirements*](https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/4583/~/4k-uhd-netflix-content-on-nvidia-gpus)*.* **I personally use a 4th-Gen Intel CPU.**
* [*A Netflix plan*](http://www.netflix.com/ChangePlan) *that supports streaming in Ultra HD.* **Naturally, you have to actually pay for UHD content to view UHD content. (and 1440p)**
* *A steady internet connection speed of 25 megabits per second or higher.* **This isn't strictly true, my connection is 19 megabits or less generally and I get the 3840\*2160 resolution with no bufferingt issues.**
* [*Streaming quality*](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/87) *set to* ***Auto*** *or* ***High****.*

Just one more from me, you should be using **Microsoft HEVC video extensions** if it still doesn't work: [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/hevc-video-extensions/9nmzlz57r3t7?activetab=pivot:overviewtab](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/hevc-video-extensions/9nmzlz57r3t7?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)

"Personal ""Skip Moments"" in TitlesI want to throw out a feature in my wishlist here for validation: Wouldn't it be useful if users were able to set a profile-level configuration to skip selective moments/scenes in a title when watching by myself, so that it becomes re-watchable with wider family/friends circle?

I think it would help in different ways:

* Title may be amazing, I might want to watch it with kids/others in family - but I might be uncomfortable doing so just because of 1-2 moments (few seconds, typically)
* Title may be great, but a specific scene may be triggering to someone in family for some reason, making the entire title unwatchable

I feel such a feature might drive up re-watches + build traction with any OTT platform.",0,747,129

"Help Netflix with 4k!!!Hey there hopefully someone can help with this as I've tried EVERYTHING. 

I am trying to watch 4k Netflix on windows 10 on my Samsung U28E590D, I installed the 1.29$ HEVC codex restarted everything. Made sure my plan was on the premium option, set playback to high (it's always been on high), and alas nothing works.

After some more digging, it looks like this display is ""not HDCP 2.2 Compliant"" does that really mean I cannot watch 4k Netflix on this screen at all? if there is a workaround id love to know.... seems silly as Netflix does not give me an error when trying to play content it just caps at 1080p, as well I've seen conflicting information on if there is compliance so yeah I'm frustrated just want to watch 4k stuff.

This post might seem a bit atrocious to some of you, but read it till the end.

A [Netflix for news](https://officiallyhaven.wordpress.com/2021/01/28/why-we-need-a-netflix-for-news/) basically means, things in the Netflix style, but it‚Äôs all about news- everything that‚Äôs happening around the world- everything that‚Äôs trending and everything that isn‚Äôt. Imagine having top-notch content made around the type of toothbrush your fave celeb uses, or the latest cringe shit tik tok users did- it would be amazing right? Or at the very least, it would make sense?

It's everything Netflix does- all the shows and the movies and stuff like that, but in this type of thing- they all center around news- everything going on in the world, the trends and stuff like that. It could be daily type of shows, the whole year could have a recap movie style, and people could have a wider platform to raise their voice and give flight to their opinions.

IDK, to me it makes a bit sense. Also, I‚Äôm not saying we need something like this right now. I‚Äôm just saying having a Netflix for news *wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be a bad idea.*

**What do all of you think? Would it be good? Would ya'll go watch it? if yes, what types of shows or episodes or dramas would you like a ‚Äònews netflix‚Äô to have? do talk shows count as news? if news netflix really becomes a thing, do you think it could possibly even overrun newspapers?**",0,1600,248

"Why is there no ""censored version"" option?Netflix movies and shows are known for their nudity, sex and other R rated stuff in general. While I understand that a censored version could probably mess with the story or cinematics, I don't understand why Netflix chooses not to offer a censored version even for those who don't want to sit through unnecessary sex scenes. I also understand that it's probably not possible for them to censor content which they didn't create, but they could just have it for Netflix originals. If there's any specific reason why this option doesn't exits, please let me know. The reason I ask is because Netflix has come under a lot of fire in my country for having prolonged and unnecessary ""adult scenes"" (my country is extremely socially conservative) and the government is in talks to forcefully censor Netflix's content like they do with theatre releases.",0,888,149

I.E Comedy, Sci-Fi, Anime, Kids etc.

Dedicated movie channels too.. Maybe even pop up channels for holidays or to promote new shows or new seasons of shows

Look, I know why people went to streaming and ditched traditional TV, they wanted to watch whenever they wanted.. But on the otherhand, Netflix DOES struggle with the issue of decision fatigue.. 

The ""I'm Feeling Lucky"" Feature IS a step in the right direction sure, but I believe linear channels are still better for content discovery..

I'm particularly fond of Outlander because of the sex scene to violence ratio and the story is divine (the books are great too, if you're only a show watcher so far) but I've seen it a hundred times. Starz also has some other great offerings not on Netflix I don't think [The White Queen/recently the Spanish Princess comes to mind] but I feel like there are some gems on Netflix I've just missed or over-looked some how.

"Netflix audio problems with default 5.1 surround over 2.0 stereoI have an unfortunate problem with Windows 10 Netflix app. I tried watching a few episodes of Brooklyn Nine-Nine but all or most of the sound was unhearable. I found out that the sound setting defaults to 5.1 surround sound and I have 2.0 headphones. Selecting the 2.0 stereo audio fixed the problem for a single episode but as soon as the next one started, the audio reverted back to 5.1.

I tried googling for a solution but as I found no clues as how to set a default audio mode preference, I figured I better contact Netflix support. English is my third language, but I've attached the relevant bits of the transcript to help others troubleshoot if they ever face a similiar situation. In the end, Netflix Customer Support couldn't help me, but they gave me something to try which I'm hoping will work for others.

"Best Non-English Netflix show of the past 2 years?What is the best Non-English show to launch recently? I watched and loved some of the first wave like Money Heist, Dark and Elite.

But most more recent shows don't have many reviews on RottenTomatoes so it's tough to tell if they're any good. Is Alice in Borderland worth watching? Sweet Home? Barbarians? Ragnarok? Quicksand? etc.",0,382,64

"K-Dramas are the only reason I've kept my Netflix accountIt's not that there aren't other shows or films that haven't directly appealed to me (Sense8, Anne With An E, Godless and One Day At A Time were all gems) but in terms of overall quality and creative control allowed, I find a lot of the material Netflix produces extremely... lacking? Out of the most recent dramas, Warrior Nun has probably come closest to keeping me entertained and it's not like I didn't have any problems with that either. I love slowburn, long-ranging and well planned arcs more than anything, and something about the ""let's see how many seasons this takes to run dry"" model doesn't really appeal to me.

I was just about to cancel, when I watched my first Chinese drama, The Untamed, and I fell in love. But there's another free legal streaming site (Rakuten Viki) which has better subtitles, so that wasn't a reason to stay. Then I decided to dip my toes into Korean dramas, and the ones that Netflix have produced are absolutely out of this world. In terms of cinematography, heart, humour, pacing... there are some that don't appeal to me as well, but a lot of them have a very consistent quality, they've become the only reason I've kept up my subscription to Netflix.

I've come to realise that I need subtitles to watch shows or films because my brain struggles to process sound, so that has not really been a problem for me. I get irritated when spoken English isn't subtitled, but other than that I have had no personal complaints‚Äîthough this is different with everybody. One of my friends has taken one of the rather more drastic routes of learning Korean so that she can understand the shows better without subtitles because of her dyslexia. Not everybody will go THAT far, but there was just so much good content missed before in my life because it took reading a few lines of text to access it. 

Between Itaewon Class, Crash Landing On You, It's Okay To Not Be Okay, Hospital Playlist, Mystic Pop-Up Bar, Kingdom... not to mention the non-Netflix original gems, like My Mister, Prison Playbook, or Healer that are on Netflix, there are so many shows that‚Äîeven if they might not even appeal directly to me sometimes‚Äîare undeniably good quality. I wish that more people over here could give them a try.",0,2292,403

Since my depression has made writing a laborious task anyway, the thought of what waits after I finish this movie/episode is itself a strong stimulus to keep me away. And if I do end up giving in to my depressive urge to just watch sthg, by writing a review afterward I will at least do away with the feeling of worthlessness.",0,712,129

So, I started watching a Brazilian Portuguese movie and decided to try out the dubbing for once. Boy, is there a big difference between the two sometimes!  

The main character dubbing said ""Your mother-in-law wouldn't stay quiet"" and the subtitles read, ""That bitch wouldn't shut up."" This totally changes the context between the characters and the relationship.

"Has anyone else had an issue with Netflix constantly rejecting passwords? I'm really frustrated here and Help support keeps telling me to just reset. I am now resetting my password every two months.Hi all,

I'm hoping someone can give me some insight to my problem because their Help department has done jack all. Their solution every time I call or ask for help on live chat is to reset my passwords and re-log all of my devices and has completely ignored the root of the issue.

To preface this let me at least mention that I build computers and have basic programming knowledge. I am no stranger to software and hardware troubleshooting and while I am no software engineer, I'm not an idiot either. 

A few years ago, I was getting locked out of my account due to (what I'm assuming was) several brute-force breaches of account from out of country IP addresses. The primary e-mail of the account was changed and the password, while still keeping my CC information. This prompted me to take more serious precautions to my account and the breaches stopped after I made a password that was 25+ characters in length. This is important because I meticulously started keeping track of my passwords and when they were changed so I could better secure *all* of my accounts. Netflix said they did not have access to my CC information, but I had serious doubts since they obviously don't have even basic protection of brute force attempts and no DDoS security.

I changed the password, wrote the password down, logged in with my desktop (saved login info within the browser) with this absurdly long string of characters, and then log the TVs in with same password. Everything would be fine. Eventually, my mom and dad would log out of the Netflix account on the TVs and I would go attempt to log into the account with the same absurdly long password. Its invalid. Perhaps I entered it in wrong? Double Check. No. Maybe I copied the password down wrong? I went back into my computer and recovered the password via my saved info within the browser. Still invalid. Maybe I neglected to save the updated password within my browser? So I went into my account info with my already logged in account on my browser, clicked 'change password' where it asks you to enter the current password and prompt you to enter a new one. 

Now, There's a way within the browser code to decrypt the censored password information to show you what the characters are. All you have to do is select the 'dots' of the password, right click, and select Inspect Element and the code will show you what the password is. Sometimes with different websites you have to change the parameters to 'type' to see it but Netflix shows you exactly what was saved previously. It was the same. Essentially, if the device is logged out for any reason Netflix is automatically telling me my password is invalid and I'm forced to recovery mode. 

Each time I call Netflix and tell them my problem, they just tell me to reset and re-log my devices. Today the live chat representative told me to make sure my browser security preferences is set to remember my password information and restarting browser, and trying to relog. It was already saved to that setting, and he basically said well you just have to reset your password again sorry. I begged him to make a bug report to their IT department and he said ""I will do that have a nice day"" and ended the chat. Not only is this bad customer service but only proves to me Netflix's programming is complete utter garbage. 

I hope somebody, *anybody*, can give me some insight or peace of mind because it would be easier than trying to get my elderly parents to understand technology.",0,3680,652

"Netflix series' are now getting way too shortJust finished watching Fate: The Wynx Saga and yet again, I was disappointed. Not by the actual content produced, but by the lack of it. After watching the first five episodes of the six-part season, you could easily see the final conflict coming to an end but in a single episode? Looking at other Netflix 2021 and even some 2020 shows, it is painfully obvious that all of the content Netflix is releasing is slowly shortening by the year. Other shows such as Lupin have also had so much potential than to be a 5-part mini-series that it pains me.

Obviously, Covid-19 is a huge factor to why shows may be shortening as well, but if or when we are past this phase, I see it hard for Netflix or streaming services alike to go back to producing more episodes in a season purely because they are making more profit due to cutting their expenses while retaining their customer base.

"Rewatching Wild Wild CountryReally loved this series and it was a lot of fun to rewatch it and reconsider my first impressions. 

I initially left thinking Osho was this big mysterious figure, but seeing it again I think you learn everything about him you need to from the glimpses you get. The drugs, the expensive cars, living in luxury while his followers lived in huts and worked all day, he's years of silence only to be broken so he can call Sheela a bitch on TV. I get most cult leaders are frauds and not good people, but I really gotta wonder how he convinced so many people to follow him. How someone as shallow and crass as him actually managed to build himself up as an enlightened being. Obviously a lot of thanks for that go to Sheela's work, but she herself is clearly deeply brainwashed.

Speaking of the followers, I never picked up on it the first time (though I know I should have) but it was funny to notice how many of the interviewed followers found the cult during tough times in their life. Just funny, theyre explaining why finding the cult meant so much to them while just inadvertently showing the typical cult MO of seeking out susceptible people to brainwash. 

A lots also been said of the people of Antelope, how obviously adverse to change they were. However, watching again I definitely saw the same attitude in the cult members. Its funny, Im so used to seeing these types of cults really push the whole ""Be peaceful, be modest"" mindset. They were definitely unique in how they were very outward in their superiority complex. ""We're all smart caused we've figured life out, everyone else is dumb, fuck you"". I also dont buy the narrative that if they were left alone they wouldve just continued on peacefully. They were clearly up to shady shit from day one and were confrontational and aggressive by nature. Another cult? Maybe they wouldve lived peacefully, but this specific one was a ticking time bomb. 

What didnt change is I still think its weird how quickly the documentary skims over the attempted murder. We dont even find out the guy survived until much later on, and even then in a throwaway line. It seems, narratively, really keen to sweep that act under the rug and move on to Sheelas big exodus and ""finding herself"". I felt more sympathy for the woman who injected him, as she clearly shows a lot of remorse for what she did. Conversely, I became aware at just how adverse Sheela is throughout the whole documentary to admitting any fault. All her soundbites are on how she was a victim, how smart she was surrounded by idiots, and how she was working for the greater good; she never once acknowledges any of the bad things she did. The drugging, the poisoning, the attempted murder; not once does she comment on them, let alone expresses remorse.

In fact, I left the series thinking people who watched and found Sheela someone to idolise to be kinda disturbed. She's not a ""boss bitch"", she's someone who used her considerable power to hurt a lot of people and then laughed about it on TV. ""Oh she didnt do a good job!"".",0,3073,550

"Unpopular opinion : Lupin is a very mediocre seriesReviews were good, comments on reddit were positives, even local critics were good so I decided to watch this series.

Wow, I could not have been more disappointed by the overall quality of this show. Acting is terrible. Omar Sy is a great actor and I think he elevates the acting quality in the show, but even him has very poor moments, it's just cringy. Watched in French by the way, my first language, so I don't have any language bias on this one.

There are plot holes every 2 minutes. Story feels vastly accelerated. Characters' motivations are weak as hell, there is absolutely no reason for them to do what they do, the way they do it. This made the show unwatchable from the first minutes. The ending is weak and not believable a second.

My guess is Netflix tried hard to come up with a Sherlock 2.0 and faily greatly (story from a well known ""old"" series of books transposed in a contemporary setting, Paris vs London, with likeable characters/actors, comedy/drama). Even the music wants to sound like Sherlock but is only a pale copy.

Sure some of the photography is cool, but thats the case for pretty much every show now. It would be sad to settle for this kind of failed series, thinking this is what's passing for ""good"" now. Am I missing something?",0,1317,236

But Netflix has a bad habit of prioritizing itself over my other phone apps when it comes to the volume button on the side of the phone if I press it while Netflix is casting it will control the TV volume and I then have to manually select the media control to turn down other apps such as games. This is super annoying. Even if I toggle on or off the ""Enable volume keys for media"" option on the phone Netflix still takes priority when pressing the volume key.

"PSA: The Last Season (4) of Call My Agent is Coming to Netflix This Thursday, 01/21/2021I only found out by browsing Netflix's ""Coming Soon"" section on Android. You should be able to confirm by doing the same. Trailer link [Here](https://www.netflix.com/watch/81381754).

Call My Agent is one of the truly well hidden gems in Netflix's library. Centered on an elite talent agency in Paris, the series takes an often humorous and sometimes sentimental look at the daily grinds of managing high-profile actors. And the actors are as prestigious as they come. Episodes guest star a veritable list of contemporary who's who in French cinema and television, including such international heavyweights as Jean Dujardin and Monica Bellucci. The stories tend to cast a humane light on the guest stars, focusing on their struggles to balance work with life, fame with privacy, ideals with reality, and so forth.

Tying all the episodes together are the stories surrounding the extraordinary people of Agence ASK. How would you feel about the future of your company if its leadership is composed of an unpredictable micromanager, an ambitious schemer, a hotheaded go-getter, and an idealistic bum? Toss in a few more interesting characters and some dramas here and there, and the result is predictably entertaining. I had so much fun watching the agents trying to resolve their clients' issues when they could barely manage their own. Like all the best series, Call My Agent makes you care about its characters.

I am very excited for season 4. Jean Reno will and Sigourney Weaver (What?!) will both make an appearance. As season 4 [will reportedly be the series' last](https://variety.com/2020/tv/global/call-my-agent-france-televisions-netflix-to-end-with-season-four-1203503040/), now is the perfect time to start binging.

"Night Stalker: Frank Falzon's Questioning TacticsObligatory apology if this has been discussed already, I did not find a similar post.  


The Night stalker was obviously a terrible human being who needed to be caught but how the detectives acquired his information seemed a bit off. During episode three, the San Francisco Homicide Detective, Frank Falzon, who was first to learn of the Night Stalker's last name and subsequently his identity discussed at length how he acquired that information - he physically beat someone he was questioning. Frank recalled driving out to a suspected acquaintance of the Night Stalker, approaching the man, and asking for his friend's last name. After the acquaintance refused to answer, Frank described detaining(?) the acquaintance in his vehicle. Once the acquaintance refused to answer for a second time, Frank discussed in the documentary about how he hit him to which the acquaintance mocked him. Frank went on about how after he was mocked he beat the man until he gave up the Night Stalker's last name.

Obviously this information was crucial to catching the Night Stalker but if how this information was acquired, was known, at the time, would it not be inadmissible? Something about a former Police Detective going on, publicly, about beating information out of someone who choose not to answer his questions just does not sit right. Though maybe it was just me since I could not find any articles related to Frank's physical assault on someone to acquire information.

Did it seem off to anyone else while Frank recalled beating a man in the back of his vehicle for information?

I know, the show has received some outrage regarding their presentation of crime photography and the events and here I am asking, did y'all feel uneasy while a Police Detective openly discussed beating an innocent man? Can't wait to learn in episode four that he was not so innocent...",0,1913,317

IM GONNA SAY IT...I DIDNT LIKE THE NIGHTSTALKER SHOW....It just was so boring. Like no detail was really involved and it was kind of light and dry.

"Am I alone in thinking Night Stalker was a bit of a turd?I felt like this was a little short of the other docuseries that Netflix has dropped lately.

Also, was really looking forward to hearing some of the interview content from Richard Ramirez.

"Question about process of making a Netflix documentaryI would really appreciate some insight into this, as I'm writing a novel that involves the making of a true crime documentary for Netflix (or really any streaming/ production company). I truly have no idea how it works -  specificially these points:

1. Who at Netflix comes up with the idea for a specific documentary? Is there a specific department for this? Are there different departments based on different topics? (My fictional documentary is true crime)
2. What would be the job title of the person who reaches out to potential interviewees, to see if they would participate in the documentary? 
3. Do they pay people to participate in the documentary as interviewees? If so, any rough idea of the compensation? 
4. Typically how long does it take to produce a two-hour documentary? How about a 5 part series documentary?
5. I assume the steps of making a documentary go something like this: Concept (storyboarding, outline, scripting) --&gt; Shooting --&gt; Editing/ Producing --&gt; Advertising &amp; Release. Is there anything I'm missing? 
6. Anything else I should know about this process or Netflix/ Netflix documentaries/ true crime documentaries in general!

"Is there a way to prevent Netflix Phone App from changing TV volume? [US]I have a smartphone, tablet, and TV. Netflix is installed on my smartphone and casts to my TV and surprisingly it does really well despite the age of my TV. My tablet isn't compatible with Netflix so it's not installed on it.

What I want to do is **prevent the Netflix phone app from controlling TV volume** since it's annoying. Because I also play games and send/receive calls on the phone (mostly just play games) and despite changing the ""Control media volume by default"" option on the phone Netflix still gets priority when pressing the volume button even when it doesn't have focus on the screen.

So I just want to make it so the phone app can't change TV volume it's not even needed anyway since I have a remote for the TV.",0,804,147

He swaps with a prison inmate, seriously? The worst is that if you are choosing burglaries out of a mystery novel, you won't be using Anagrams of the protagonist's name. I thought that was stupid until I saw that the police officer who is actually decoding name anagrams and on a lead is termed stupid. That is a CLUE, can the police not see it?

"Netflix Shits Out Shows Like Never Before!Recently, in the past year of internet history, Netflix has upped it's game to not only battle the multimedia giants such as Disney, Hulu, Amazon Prime, and HBO, but the pandemic itself. In 2019 it seems that Netflix didn't release that many shows. They released 371 series and movies which is down from 2018. But in 2020 it seems as if they really upped their game. Not only does it seem as if they gained a lot more big shows and movies but the creation of new ones, and the purchasing of old ones. That's right I'm talking about Netflix originals. Shows that Netflix produces themselves meaning they don't have to license it from some corporation or studio like Disney. They own it. Recently they've added more and more originals, many were not at first but were later bought out by Netflix such as ""The Good Place"" and ""Lucifer"". It seems that everywhere I look on Netflix, I see the little red ""N"" in the top right corner. And not only are they abundant, but almost all of them are of an amazing quality. They're also producing them at an incredible rate. Take ""The Great Pretender"" for example. They released the show and it became a hit. 3-4 months later and it already has a completed second season. Do you know why that's strange? Most animated shows take half a year to an entire year to release a second season. They've cut this time immensely, this is almost unheard of. Netflix has upped it's game this year and stays in the lead when it comes to streaming services. Netflix reigns king.",0,1542,277

And now I have no way of controlling it, despite the fact that my profile settings are set to 'highest available quality.' 

Currently getting 80mb/s speeds over ethernet connection so it's not a wifi signal issue. 

Paying for the Ultra HD package so that's not the issue. 

I heard that they've now removed full HD support from non-Edge browsers or apps so this is all with me trying it on Edge, which is ridiculous to begin with.

Is there a way around this or am I going to have to go back to the high seas?

He then said that due to them all being there, there must be the possibility of them all surviving. 

That is not really true, because of what we have seen before in that Tag game, where there were in fact 2 ‚Äúchasers‚Äù having the different objective of killing everyone and not allowing them to reach the safety area.

He then ‚Äúthinks as the game master‚Äù and says that the only possibility is that it could only be herself.

Why did he think so? Firstly I concluded that it couldn‚Äôt be the military since they had weapons and would just use them. Except of the idea with the fingerprints on the weapon I didn‚Äôt really find any other people to be 100% innocent.

So all in all: How did Arisu figure out that the only possibility who could have been the killer would be the woman herself?

First post here so I hope this is the right place and appropriate. Thank you on everyone reading this post.",0,1134,204

Can this Hollywood people merely think about the f*** TRAUMA it is to participate in wars started by adults as a kid ? Can this people even think of how it isn't ""cool"" to use child labor ?

I get it part 4 was rushed but that was a direct result of being canceled before filming and condensing to a rewritten script to wrap it up. In netflix eyes basically if the show doesn't score 90% or higher it gets cancelled. It's becoming a problem and popular jem's often end up with poor unfinished endings. At this point I'm just done. If they are going cancel everything that doesn't hit Stranger Things adornment and wrap them up with budget endings there's no reason to stick around.",0,667,124

The Crown is historical fiction and based on the life of Queen Elizabeth but we know the queen is fine right now (as of writing). So where is the climax? What is everything building upto? 

Or is The Crown just an inside look at how the royal family operates? Putting out fires wherever they pop up, not really building up-to anything but super interesting nevertheless?

"Media Portrayed as Scumbags in the Manhunt Series?Does anyone get the vibe that the media is portrayed as HUGE scumbags in the Manhunt series about the Unabomber and the Centennial Park Olympic Bombing?

I already knew about the lack of media integrity from the Olympic Park Bombing because of the Richard Jewell movie that came out last year. I feel like it would be hard for anyone to argue Kathy Scruggs wasnt a horrible human being.

The Unabomber episodes show CBS strong arming the FBI by giving them 24 hours to arrest the Unabomber before going public with the story and essentially ruining their chances at making an airtight case. 

I understand these are dramatic retellings of what happened so the truth might be stretched but it seems like the media is working counter to the interests of the American people. Thoughts?",0,832,142

I have never watched this show and have no interest in ever doing so. I've already given it a negative rating to get it to go away from the recommended shows on my home screen, but there seems to be no way to stop the ads unless I just wait them out until the next show netflix wants to over promote appears.  I don't expect to be served all of these ads considering that I'm paying for an ad-free experience. Customer support was useless. They just copy pasted information on how the recommendation engine works. I already know all of that, and it's not relevant to the ads I'm being shown while in the middle of another show. I am not asking how to get this show to stop appearing in my recommendations.

"Are you aware of a Zombie show / apocalypse show where the characters do not make stupid decisions ?Hey guys ! 

As it happens, I am quite a huge fan of tv shows and movies that treat the fascinating subject of the end of times and how an everyday Joe would react to it. 

However, be it the latest seasons of the Walking dead, or the recent Black Summer on Netflix, it seems that these are plagued with one downside that I cannot bear anymore - Stupid decisions. 

I get it that panic and the end of times can lead people to make bad choices. I do enjoy these actually, when these decisions tend to be in line with the characters. However, these shows that I mentionned seems to be ridden of those, to the point that theere are quite unwatchable. 

Without spoiler, but for a general idea, these would for instance the following: 

\-  ""Hey I really need to go for a walk outside our heavily secured compound..:""

\- ""Why, it is dangerous !""

\- ""YEAH BUT I NEED SPACE OK""

Boum danger and bitten.

Or, the famous ""let's welcome these survivors despite the fact that they are sketchy af and let's lower our guards when we are with them (The school episode of Black Summer was really unwatchable because of it, despite one of the best first and second episode of the genra i saw!)

Thus, would you be aware of such show that would be closer to World War Z (the book) than to Season 8 of TWD ?

"Bridgerton.... Just wow, blown awayNormally I've never enjoyed Jane Austen film or TV or any victorian period dramas like Downington Abbey- and honestly Sherlock Holmes with RDJ was about as invested in this era as I thought I'd ever be. I usually stick to sci-fi like The Expanse, Mandalorian, or even Legion or like Vikings -- not society dramas.  But this one is different!

**The script and dialogue** was on point- very witty and full of humor and drama, lot of 'on snap' moments  

It's only 8 episodes mini series- there wasn't any need for a second season, **everything wrapped up** pretty nicely.  

 The relationships between character, and the growth the characters experienced - their arcs were just so satisfying. That was the best part for me!

**The costume and sets** we very well done and super fancy- there was a bit of CGI to get the era backgrounds right- but it was okay.  

The most important this was how relatable the story was - it was weird like a different time still the same shit, and the writers focused on the struggles that we share, I think.

"I wish they would release a ""The Art of..."" book for The Willoughbys just like they published one for KlausJust watched this movie and am in love with it. I think the pacing of the movie was all over the place, but I was totally sold on the animation style, the fast-paced irreverent humor, and all of the character design and visual development styling that crafted the world we see in the movie.

I liked this movie so much that i really would be interested in buying an ""The Art/Making of..."" hardcover of it so i can add it to my library of animation art books (its something im really into) and see all o the development art that went into the film. but there doesn't seem to be one that exists as far as my Google searching powers can show me. Really disappointed in that area since Netflix/SPA studios made an art book for Klaus, and that this movie could very well be nominated for Best Animated Picture this year just like Klaus was last year.

"i just watched The Titan and im disapointed with its endingi hated the ending mostly because my morality is very diffrent from others i wouldnt say flawed.

anyway i hated how selfish his wife was he knew the risks himself maybe not all of them his creator and funder was at fault because he doesnt tell the family everything he is vague and only tells them in the momment which is on him and a big factor the failure of the whole project 

but ricks wife is to blame too becuase she wouldnt let go rick said that hes doing this for the family and have his kid live a good life a better life even. but she cant let go shes too damn selfish and decides to plot out a plan where she pumps saline into him at the end and get innocent soldiers killed who are simply following orders. 

i also hate how they killed the female titan that justifies nothing rick killed many innocent soldiers and was not at all punished. when the female was on the ground and killed that soldier they should have kept tranqing her or whatever knockout solution that was until she was down for good then send them to titan that way they can both repourduce. and i saw that the female titan was bonding with rick.

how i would of liked the ending personally maybe you agree

the immorale Ending: Rick bonds with the female titan and he takes on her path and kills all his bonds his wife and kid then they wait for the soldiers and get tranqed from there getting sent to titan and saving their race.

The Compromise ending: when all the soldiers are pointing their rifles at the family at the end with the scientist the mother should have just let go and take lucas letting the creator send rick to titan and create more of him to send up there yet improve from his other mistakes and create a evolution path to become a titan  that doesent lead to chaos. because i see it as theyre gonna need to make everyone a titan and if its done like this everytime than everyones screwed",0,1950,368

"Strange behavior with different language soundtracksI‚Äôm normally in the US &amp; have profiles Mandarin, French, and Spanish for listening practice. I‚Äôve been in Sri Lanka since the pandemic, and had vaguely noticed that the options for programming with Mandarin dubs were different, and French/Spanish was much fewer, but didn‚Äôt think more about it until today. Just now watched a couple kids‚Äô cartoons with Mandarin dub, then switched to French &amp; Spanish profiles to confirm that those languages weren‚Äôt available. Oddly, they ONLY showed English. Not even the Mandarin dub soundtrack I‚Äôd JUST watched for the exact same shows in a different profile. 

The interface language was English for all profiles (or blank actually, according to the profile drop-down). Within my ‚ÄúFrench‚Äù profile I then changed the language to French, which allowed French dubs to appear even though they‚Äôre still not showing the Mandarin option that I‚Äôd just seen.

I‚Äôm fine with the workaround, but it seems quite odd, was curious if anyone else had noticed something like this.",0,1062,168

Now that we're retired (and with this pandemic lock down), we have a ton of time on our hands. So this subscription made a lot of sense, particularly as we can watch these shows in the original and not German. You might be surprised how much gets cut in the foreign editions.

Ignoring actual content, they've already stripped away all forms of rating or review, so we have to do an imdb search to see if something is trash ahead of time, and made it impossible to filter genres we have zero interest in. Now they're removing basic account features??   

They're changing gears HARD back towards piracy in terms of quality &amp; availability imo. People have already been saying ""*I'm not paying $10/mo for 8 different services*"" and lol welp, that's now 20/mo for just the one. It's just cable atp and *guess what got canceled 15 years ago!*

"Netflix keeps freezing my pc, need to rebootHi all,  


basically loading the Netflix website, in any browser (chromium-based or firefox) causes my pc to completely freeze. Basically, when I load the website, as soon as I move the cursor around, it blocks, and from that moment, I CAN'T do a thing, except for pressing the power button and rebooting.  
It does not happen every time, but a week ago, and for the past 3 months it went quite fine. I had like 1/2 freeze per month. Now it happened yesterday to totally not being able to use the website (moved to the windows app). It works fine on my smartphone, I did not try on Linux yet, and sometimes also the app has this horrific behavior.   
It's still a mystery to me, HOW can a web app completely lock up a pc in this way. I tried disabling the hardware acceleration with no resolution at all, and no significant improvements.  
My specs are Ryzen 5 2600, 8GB RAM, Radeon R9 280, Gigabyte B450M-DS3H. I used to have this problem too, before changing CPU/Mobo/RAM/adding SSD. I thought it could be HDD's fault, as it happened to lock the entire pc when in high load. However, how can Netflix use more than 70% of my HDD? Now I'm on an SSD that works fine, so the problem might be the GPU that hasn't been changed, but still don't know how tf this can happen

"Is Netflix lowering the bitrate drastically when you're using one device for several days? Changing devices seems to ""fix"" the issue for a while.The super low bitrate for Full HD and 4k titles starts to get on my nerves. I have quality 80mbit internet and all other streaming services and apps deliver great quality, but with Netflix I experienced the following (streaming a few episodes a day, not constantly):

* I was able to watch a show on the Samsung TV app with great quality (flawless 4K and HDR). At a certain point (a few days/weeks in) the quality gets unbearable, independent of the content (Star Trek, documentaries, 4k shows, etc) and the time of day. Unplugging the TV and restarting the modem and the router doesn't help, the TV app never gets its initial quality back.
* I bought a FireStick with 4k -&gt; excellent quality with everything on Netflix, all the time. Thought I solved the ""issue"" (overflowing RAM of the TV or whatever). Maybe a week later, the content is as shitty as on the TV app.
* Got a Chromecast Ultra (Stadia deal) at the end of last year and tried Netflix -&gt; amazing video quality. Now -&gt; absolutely shitty image again (720p or lower).
* Today I was annoyed by the Chromecast quality and tried watching Star Trek on the TV app again. Suddenly it has perfect Full HD quality, no pixelation etc. 

So what does that mean? Does Netflix grant you nice quality with a new device and then constantly lowers the bitrate for this device? Do I have to rotate between the 4 devices (laptop included) now, so I keep getting good quality?

I really have no other explanation for these bitrate drops, and it looks like there's a pattern. Did anyone experience something similar?",0,1712,302

"Ripper (2020)I had high hopes for this series and was excited to start it. Unfortunately the only real thing it did was shine a light on how dysfunctional police forces are world wide. 

When they incapable of solving something, or just bad at their jobs and fully inept; they revert to so much subtext victim blaming it‚Äôs staggering. Within the first 10 minutes of the first episode they pointed out they felt the first few victims were ‚Äúprostitutes‚Äù no less than 14 times and that the occurrences were in ‚Äúslums ‚Äú full of ‚Äúimmigrants and minorities‚Äù. 

Why is that a problem you ask? What does that do? It desensitizes you to the crime, and is focused on dehumanizing the person and making them nothing more than their assumed profession. It basically says, ‚Äúwell if she was not a degenerate prostitute, she would be fine‚Äù. They even flat out say it was not uncommon for prostitutes to be killed and were essentially just hoping it wouldn‚Äôt happen again and did not do much work to solve the first few. 

Why people think Cops are good people is beyond me. It‚Äôs like joining the military. Minimal training, easy to qualify and higher than average income with things like unions in place to protect them from ever facing consequences to their incompetence.",0,1257,219

"Are my partner and I crazy, or does The Queen's Gambit have some absolutely awful dialogue and acting (spoilers)?After all of the hype, the two of us are pretty incredulous.

""My tranquility needs to be refurbished"" and ""I asked for a pleasant room, and I believe they gave me one"" are two that spring to mind. We can't tell if Alma's supposed to just be freaking crazy, or if the actress/writing is terrible.

Or what about Beth calling herself an ugly fucker in the bathroom mirror? That characterization came out of nowhere. We've slowly come to realize that we enjoy the show the most when nobody is saying anything at all. Crocodile Dundee just showed up in the episode we're watching, and we had to pause because of how ridiculous it all was.

"The Midnight Sky ending (spoilers)Okay so for the 1st and 2nd acts I was okay with the movie because I felt it was building towards something but alas the 3rd act came and I was utterly disappointed.   People have pointed out the film's shortcomings including falling in freezing water in the artic but my issue with the film is less about those issues (e.g. imaginary girl cannot/should not have a POV outside of the protagonist's POV) and more about its thematic issues.  

Namely the ending.  Okay so we find out the girl is the imagined version of his daughter he regretted not meeting that one day.  But why didn't he just go down to the car and meet her?  Why was he an aloof a-hole to the love of his life when she said she got a false positive pregnancy test?  Why won't he even look at her?  We're only given 3 scenes of young Augustine and none do a good job explaining who this man is underneath the surface.  The ending payoff doesn't work because it isn't earned.  We don't care about his relationship with his daughter now because it wasn't clear why he couldn't have a relationship with her back then.  The plot called for him to be emotionally distant in the flashback scenes so we could have a heartwarming father-daughter surprise at the end.  It didn't work for me.

Also, the ""false"" positive pregnancy?  Was his gf (wife?) lying to him or telling the truth? Either way it makes her actions look foolish.  If she was telling the truth then that means after she gives her ""break up"" monologue about him being a selfish explorer ruining his life that would mean she had sex with him at least one more time after that and got pregnant with Iris.  Or if she's lying about not being pregnant just so she can move on with her life with her child without this selfish man intruding on their lives, then why does she have a nonchalant conversation with him years later where he is aware of Iris' existence and she's not bothered with him still not wanting to meet their daughter? It doesn't add up either way.

"LG TV - Netflix extremely slow compared to other appsI have come across a very weird issue with my BX. 

My Internet is fast enough to stream 4K content. And the built in apps are capable of it (Prime and YouTube). However, Netflix is not. 

Netflix hovers around a bitrate of 0,5-2 and manages 480p at most. I have turned up the playback setting on my Netflix account to high, no change. 

Now the really odd thing: Netflix support directed me to fast.com, their own speed test. On my TV, it tops out at 3 Mbit at most, 80% of the time it doesn't manage more than 1. But when using speedtest.com I get around 30 Mbit which is lower than my other devices but fast enough to stream 4k. 

This discrepancy doesn't happen on my other devices though. On these, speed is consistent throughout. 

I have done the following:

1) Wired vs Wifi. Wired is what I'm running and it's marginally better than Wifi. 

2) Different routers. I have my ISP router and my own one. Same result with both. 

Has anyone experienced anything like this? It's really driving me insane because the quality sucks absolute ass but more importantly it is such a weird issue I don't know what to do.",0,1169,213

"English subtitles becoming unavailable after moving to AustriaI'm having a slightly odd problem with certain shows on Netflix (mostly anime). Namely, only German subtitles/dubs are available for them (and of course, original Japanese). No other options. The bizarre part is that it's affecting shows that I KNOW have English subtitles on Netflix, as I've watched them with English subtitles previously. The option has simply become unavailable after my move to Austria. 

For example, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood - I've watched the first 2 and half seasons with English subs before my move (and it has English audio available), but when I try to continue it now, it only offers German and Japanese.

I have checked my language settings, and it's set to English. 

This doesn't affect everything, only a certain subset of shows, mostly anime.

Again, even shows that I have previously watched on Netflix with English subs/dubs have lost the option.

My best guess is that there is some bizarre licensing deal allowing the shows to only be streamed in German, even though the platform has other languages available, but that just sounds absurd.",0,1147,184

So my question is, for those who have seen the movie, do you believe I can prevent my life from becoming like his, and how?

I tried to go spoil free so don't worry about spoilers, I only included specific information when its revealed from the beginning)

* **Already watched**

\-Breaking Bad (highly binge watchable, and Walter going through so realistic problems of life is so relatable and I liked the slow burn of Water and his wife's relationship and how choices you made have such a profound effect on your life)

\-The Good Place (Made me question what being kind means and altruism is and the humor! It's a very funny show)

\-The End of the fucking World (I loved the british girl and boy's journey and how depressed they looked lol The teenager girl is my favorite)

\-After Life (I'm watching this rn, this man has suicidal thoughts but get support and I like how this show makes the subject feel lighter or even funny)

\-Special (I liked how salty the main character is, how sarcastic he is and the mother's love towards him, it was a turn off for me at the beginning ngl though)

\-Atypical (Very cheesy and I hated the mainstream depiction of autism at first cuz I know they don't look like the main character, but ended up enjoining it)

\-The Healing Power of Dude (I was bored so I started watching it, this kid's dog is always there for him when he's having a trouble at school and after awhile I started loving the show)

\-Everything Sucks (Well I only watched the first 5 episodes but I gotta get back to it, tbh got turned off by the childish tone and paranormal insinuation but idk do you guys think I should give it a second chance??)

\-Sex education (Watched the first 3 episodes I love it but after 1 episode I felt like there's nothing more to explore other than this main character got a role at the end of the first episode. Story wise, I thought it's not gonna progress any further and there's only jokes to enjoy, but idk should I give it a second chance too?)

So what I want you guys to do is suggest shows with at least 1 season, even if they're not similar you already know my type of shows, I'm waiting for your suggestion! I'd appreciate it if you could tell me which part you enjoyed or what the show is about.",0,2384,434

"Netflix not loading or loading very slowIve been using netflix for years now and recently when i try to access netflix on my browser on both of my pc or the tv its very slow. It either just takes forever and then comes out with an error saying slow internet and couldnt load or will load after a few minutes. Ive tried multiple browsers and also the windows 10 netflix app. Ive also cleared the cache,

The thing is if i jump on my phone and watch it on the app via wifi there is no issue at all. My neighbour next door has no issues as well and are on the same company for internet.

Im using a TP Link M5 Deco mesh network setup. Its been running for around a year now. 

anyways if anyone has any ideas what i can try out to fix this that be great!

thanks",0,759,152

"Edge and Windows App: Pardon the interruptionI need help playing Netflix on both Edge and its own PC app (from Microsoft store). I've always been streaming Netflix on them (mainly Edge), and had no issues, until yesterday. It was actually fine for me in the morning, but after that, I couldn't stream *any* titles.

The error codes I get from Edge and the app are different. The one from Edge was useless, and provided no information. [D7361-1253](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/116449?ba=SwiftypeResultClick&amp;q=D7361-1253)

I have tried shutting down, waiting 30 seconds, and turning PC back on. Did not work.

Cleared ALL data and cache, cookies, the works, from Edge. Did not work.

Browser doesn't seem likely since the app itself doesn't play either.

I almost never stream on my mobile device, but I just tried it, and it has no issues.

Firefox, however, will stream with no issues.

Just wanna know if anyone has encountered these issues before, and if anyone has successfully resolved it?

I hope it's okay to post this here. I never have experience with tech departments since the people usually just give you the basics like, hAvE yOu tRiEd rEsTarTinG yOuR cOmPuTeR?

Come on Netflix. This is so damn F-ing lazy, and becoming very common.

It‚Äôs not ok to just add a CC subtitle stream and think that‚Äôs enough. Meaning we have to have the subtitles on for the whole film. Or pause, turn CC subtitles on, rewind, play.  You catch my drift. 

The main stream would have these parts already enabled. If I choose English as the Audio Language then the subtitles should automatically come on for any non-English speaking parts.

"‚Äò5.1‚Äô surround sound misleading...I‚Äôve just realised that some content (e.g. *The Prestige*), claims to be in 5.1 surround sound, but this is a bit misleading...

It can output a Dolby Digital 5.1 signal, but this doesn‚Äôt send any audio to the centre or rear channels. The only way to get surround sound is to transmit the signal as **stereo** PCM from the TV to a receiver, and have the receiver upscale it so audio comes from the rear/centre channels. 

Other content however (e.g. *Money Heist*) claims to be 5.1 and this outputs a DD 5.1 signal directly to the centre/rear channel, with no upscaling required.

Can any audiophiles explain this? How can Netflix claim that *The Prestige* is 5.1, if you need to upscale it via stereo (as can be done with any stereo content).",0,777,135

Also, why do they even buy up only partial rights in the 1sp place?

E.g. right now, I binged 1st season of My Hero Academia,  show is from 2016-. So they had from 2017 to secure rights for season 2 and onward, and they have not. I don't feel the chances are good.",0,731,131

"I hope the Netflix formula of short seasons doesn't spread to networks and other streaming servicesI like a lot of Netflix's original content but their seasons are so short!  For some shows it doesn't bother me and seems like the right number of shows.  But other times, it is really disappointing.

It's nice having shows with 5+ seasons with 20+ episodes per season.  It's not only nice for the initial watch, but upon rewatching the series, sometimes it's like watching a new show all over again because there were so many episodes that you forgot many of them.

I'm not saying they should add filler just to make seasons longer, there are a lot of really great shows that lasted a really long time and were great for their entire run, or at least for the vast majority of their runs.

I just think it would be horrible if every content provider started following the short seasons and limited number of seasons format.  It's already horrible in some instances of netflix originals.",0,985,172

I hope Netflix takes note.  Jonathan Stroud's Bartimaeus Trilogy / Amulet of Samarkand had been optioned for TV/Movie rights all the way back in 2002 and has been languishing since.

"Unpopular Opinion: I honestly hate how Netflix won't let you exclude foreign language films from the queue.I'm sure I'm not alone as someone who enjoys the noise of a movie playing in the background, but it becomes absolutely pointless if the movie is in another language. I speak English and Korean, so when the movie happens to be Korean that's fine, but it's so unbelievably annoying to have all these foreign language films mixed into American Netflix without a way to filter them out. Oftentimes I'll read a description of a movie that sounds good, click on it and find out it's made in Malaysia or whatever, completely wasting my time. Or even Netflix's shuffle includes foreign language films, which literally defeats the purpose for me. I almost never sit down and watch a movie unless it's with friends or family, I just get so bored with passive entertainment. 

Netflix I don't give a shit that your library is dwindling. You aren't pulling the wool over anyone's eyes filling it with movies and television from other countries.

Here are a list of TV shows I've watched and my quick rating of them. These are my opinions and others will have different preferences. But I outline them for multiple reasons.

Third, same as number two, but reverse uno- maybe you'll take away a recommendation if we have overlapping tastes.

No direct spoilers involved, but I do list cancelations when I know about them and sometimes I comment on what parts of the show were good/bad including endings, without revealing specifics.

#Action

- Breaking Bad **(9/10)**

Basically a classic.

- The Umbrella Academy **(8.5/10)**

Second season was better than the first, and the first was already good! I don't know if they can keep topping it but worth the watch for now.

- Stranger Things **(8/10)**

Great first season, but I see the show getting worse with each subsequent season. 

- The 100 **(7.5/10)**

New enemies become allies when there's a newer enemy. Rinse and repeat for 5 seasons. I stopped at season 6.

- The Witcher **(7.5/10)**

A bit overhyped by people who already wanted to watch it. Getting a sense of time and geography felt missing.

- The Walking Dead **(7/10)**

Great at the start and it tampers off with the plot getting repetitive.

- Jessica Jones **(7/10)**

I thoroughly enjoyed it but I can see how it's not for everyone. Season 2 doesn't always make sense.

- The Colony **(5/10)**

I enjoyed the time watching it but the plot didn't have a lot of room for growth and it got canceled. 

- Merlin **(3/10)**

Ending was bad. King Arthur was a brat undeserving of any kind of legacy. Wtf is this even?

#Dramas

- This Is Us **(10/10)**

If you like soapy dramas, watch this. You'll find a character you love. I wouldn't recommend to anyone who doesn't like that genera.

- Dirty John **(9/10)**

Loved it. Based on true stories. Good dose of empathy and reality IMO. 

- Broadchurch **(9/10)**

Murder mystery that relies more on plot and sleuthing than a draw to gore. Second season is good as well. 

- Afterlife **(9/10)**

Funny and sad take on grief and depression. 

- Living with Yourself **(8.5/10)**

Ever wondered what the best version of yourself looks like? What would you be if you did everything right? Good concept done well.

- Queen's Gambit **(8.5/10)**

I'm glad it's only 10 episodes, this is exactly the kind of thing that needed to be longer than a movie, but not stretched over multiple seasons. 

- Black Mirror **(8.5/10)**

Some episodes are better than others. 

- The End of The F***ing World **(8/10)**

Great show, strong second season tying into the first.

- Better Call Saul **(8/10)**

Don't expect Breaking Bad, but it's still great.

- You **(8/10)**

Pretty good.

- Jane the Virgin **(8/10)**

A catholic virgin gets accidentally artificially inseminated. It's a love triangle/square/octagon depending on the season. It makes fun of telanovella tropes. Great at the start, the last season seemed a bit lazy. Soapy.

- Insatiable **(7.5/10)**

The ending frames everything you've watched slightly differently without a plot twist. Good drama. It's about beauty pageants but they're the background to the drama. Soapy, kinda.

- Orange is the New Black **(7.5/10)**

Ups and downs with the plot. While it was intended to be political, the reality of prison life is actually also very depressing, and considering this is drawn out over multiple seasons, it's actually kind of taxing to watch even if I enjoyed it.

- Gilmore Girls **(7.5/10)**

My most rewatched show on Netflix. The more I watch it the less I like it, so I had to stop. I don't know that I'd recommend it unless you've started.

- Suits **(7/10)**

Better in early and midseasons than the end. 

- Russian Doll **(6.5/10)**

Groundhog day premise with an ending I didn't like. Good concept, not a huge fan.

- Wentworth **(6.5/10)**

Orange is the New Black but Australian. Less comedy. I'd cut the last season.

- Dead to Me **(6/10)**

Watch it if you have nothing else to watch. Kinda like Good Girls.

- Outlander **(6/10)**

Interesting concept but too much sadism for the type of romantic-drama it was.

- Sherlock **(6/10)**

I'm tired of the genius sociopath narrative, even though this was popular for it's time.

- Good Girls **(6/10)**

I liked the side characters more than the protagonist and the plot was a bit dry. But it's got some humour.

- Virgin River **(5/10)**

I enjoyed it more than my rating reflects, but I know it's not for everyone. The plot isn't strong. I think I'm unconsciously rating it higher because the wide open shots of nature made me feel nice while watching it.

- Blackmirror Bandersnatch **(5/10)**

Fun to tinker with for 20 minutes to an hour, but a lot of the endings don't make sense. Constantly operating the remote detracts from enjoyment fast.

- Sex Education **(5/10)**

Good premise but as a woman in her mid20s, I felt out of place watching teenagers give each other sex advice. Some humour. I can't really conceptualize who the target audience is intended to be.

- Glitch **(4/10)**

A great concept butchered. Plotholes galore. Mixing science and magic for a confusing plot. It was canceled to boot so we don't get to have answers. Don't start watching.

#Comedies/Sitcoms


- BoJack Horseman **(10/10)**

No show has ever prompted me to look at my relationships with other people as much. Animated sitcom, not anime. Most of the comedy comes from animal puns.

- Archer **(8/10)**

Sitcom. Relies on vulgarity, crassness and repetition for comedy but it's almost always fun.

- The Good Place **(7.5)**

I'm actually currently watching it. Seems like a feel good comedy for the most part.

- Santa Clarita Diet **(7.5/10)**

Off-beat comedy with zombies. Lots of gore but not in a scary way. Probably the best zombie comedy, but it got canceled, so without an ending and some answers to questions, I can't give it a higher rating even though I really want to.

- Friends **(5.5)**

A bit nostalgic since I was growing up with my parents watching it. I don't have anything specifically positive to say about it.

- How I Met Your Mother **(4/10)**

Couldn't even finish. About a guy who loves love more than the women he supposedly loves. Like Friends, I don't think this would be funny without a laugh track. 

------------------

Happy to chat about ratings as long as it's civil. I suspect the How I Met Your Mother rating will ruffle some feathers.

Based on what I've watched and what I enjoyed, what would you recommend?

I will likely not enjoy horror, reality TV, kids stuff or anime.

I'm iffy about crime or medical shows because they usually seem like long investments that don't pay off as well as other shows. Definitely open to fantasy or sci fi, but I won't start things like star trek that will take forever.",0,7215,1236

"Netflix is Making Some Awful DecisionsJust like others, I've surprisingly been using Netflix less and less. I feel like they keep getting outdone by other streaming services like Hulu, Disney+, Amazon Prime, etc. Which yes there are good shows on there too but if Netflix were to keep the good shows they have and continue series that people actually like, then I feel like they would have a much bigger following. I think their biggest mistake at the moment has to be removing The Office, Back to the Future, The Notebook, and the list goes on. These are all very popular shows that people enjoy watching more than just once. Keeping these shows rather than removing them would be very beneficial for them. And I feel like shows like The Hollow that have a smaller following while all the people who have watched it enjoyed it, should be advertised in order to make more people see it and make more people subscribe to Netflix to watch it. Some of these amazing shows are getting canceled and it‚Äôs horrible, i almost have no respect for Netflix anymore for some of these choices they‚Äôve made recently.

"Horror recommendationsHi all,

Any horror/thriller recommendations on Netflix that have a decent storyline and good acting? Preferably a psychological horror film. Nothing horror slasher e.g. Halloween. Good acting is a must.

I recently watch on Netflix and enjoyed:
- The Autopsy of Jane Doe (good acting, decent storyline)
- The Blackcoat's Daughter (good acting, decent storyline)
- Little Evil (good acting, decent storyline and surprisingly funny)
- Girl and the Third Floor (least favorite of the three b/c of the violence/plot, acting was decent though)

I recently watched on Netflix and did NOT enjoy:
- House and the End of the Street (gruesome beginning couldn't get past that)

Some I have on my watch list
- The Invitation
- Rattlesnake
- 1BR
- The Ritual
- 13 Sins
- Pizza
- The Platform
- The Haunting of Hill House
- The Bar

"Netflix keeps replaying the same 5 episodes?This keeps happening across multiple series, like The Great British Bake-Off and Forensic Files. We'll be watching an episode from one season, then it will autoplay an episode from 3 seasons ago. For Great British Bake-Off it's the one that opens with the Wizard of Oz, without fail it will just turn on even if you skip that episode, it'll inevitably play after the episode you've switched to. I like to watch Forensic Files quite often, but it will cycle through 5 episodes and declare the series finished. Usually the episodes are ""Purr-fect Match"", ""Bio-Attack"", ""A Bag of Evidence"", and the one about the lady who fell down the stairs. If i jump to another season, one of the named episodes will start playing. If I let it play out, it'll switch to another one of the episodes, then play the last one again, then switch to a preview because the series ""finished.""

"How to disable plan upgrade popups for select viewers?Hello,

I've recently subscribed to Netflix, mostly for my parents' use. I've assigned each of them their own viewer profile, and noticed that there are sometimes popups that ask whether they'd like to upgrade to the next subscription tier. 

Is there any way to disable such popups for their individual viewer profiles? I understand that upselling is normal marketing, but there are three practical reasons: 1. they aren't always paying attention to what they are clicking; 2. they tend to get confused about unexpected interface elements; 3. I don't want them to see anything cost-related, so that they can just enjoy Netflix without getting constantly reminded that money is being spent on this. 

On a related note:

Is there a way to keep my own viewer profile but make it invisible on a certain devise (i.e. the TV that they use)? I believe I would need to maintain the profile for administrative purposes, but don't want my parents to go in and accidentally change some sort of vital setting (also, less elements, less confusing). 

Thank you! And happy holidays :)",0,1126,188

I have had the entire series purchased through iTunes since 2012. But I preferred watching it on Netflix I had access to it on far many more devices.

It‚Äôs like instead of ordering what you want online, you‚Äôd go to the mall to buy one particular thing but end up browsing other shops and maybe even get something else unplanned.  

However, now that the office is going away, I can‚Äôt think of a reason to come to Netflix. There are no comedy shows to substitute and no new content worth hanging around for (for my taste).

"Xbox: Tapping left D-pad arrow does not rewind back 10 seconds like it shouldSo when you tap the left arrow, it will rewind back 10 seconds. Let's say this, something happened 17 seconds ago. I click once to the left, then I wait 3 seconds and click left again. It will not rewind 10 seconds this second time, it will instead open up the scrolling function where it shows you a thumbnail of the scene area you are rewinding to (the normal way you rewind or fast forward). It's very irritating because you can press b and get out of that normal menu to try to rewind 10 seconds back again with the quick click and it will not work, it will continue to open up the regular scroller and show the mini thumbnail no matter how many times you press b and wait a second. You have to wait close to 10 seconds for it to allow you to skip back quickly, which defeats the purpose. HOWEVER, if you DON'T press b but press A on the mini thumbnail, it will not rewind, instead it will not do anything and just resume playing that the same spot. If you were to click back once to skip 10 seconds (and it worked), you can click left again and it will open the mini thumbnail, if you keep pressing A on that mini thumbnail/timestamp that it's showing, it will continue you at the same spot, let's say you keep doing this; every time you do it the movie will continue playing, but it will still show the same thumbnail for 10 seconds. NO MATTER WHAT if you click back for a second time and click A on that mini thumbnail, no matter how many times you do it, no matter how much time has elapsed since you were at the part of that mini thumbnail, it will continue to resume at the same spot. THE ONLY WAY to rewind again is to rewind to the mini thumbnail that is one to the left of the one that makes you resume. This might take you back 20 more seconds, 30 more, 40 more etc. SOMETIMES clicking back once with the d pad will actually rewind you 15 seconds or more, it's just really buggy.

There is a very simple solution to this, change either the controls or the reset time for the quick rewind/forward. 

Either you can make it so that the quick rewind/forward resets after 2 seconds, so that if I click the left arrow again after 2 seconds from the last time it will do the quick rewind.

OR

You could make it so that the left, and right numbers rewind, and fast forward by 5 seconds each respectively. This seems like the most logical approach to me. Wouldn't have to change much just add this it would be quick and easy.
You could make it so that only the left joystick controls the time bar controls, and the D-pad controls the quick rewinds/forwards too.

It also would be nice if you fixed that way that it works when you click on the mini thumbnails. It doesn't make sense to me that if I click left a second time, it will show a thumbnail of the clip that occurred 10 seconds ago, but when you press A on it it just resumes. It's so weird because if it was going to resume, shouldn‚Äôt it be showing what I'm currently looking at on the screen within the mini thumbnail? I understand I guess if the first mini thumbnail that you are on when you click the left arrow for the second time is actually supposed to represent n = 0, and any thumbnails to the right or left of the zeroth one are ((+10sec)(n)), but if that's the case, the base thumbnail for 0n should show the same image you are currently looking at in the movie so that that's clear and you can tell where 0n is.",0,3465,667
"Netflix's problem isn't content, it's decision fatigue.Like a lot of people recently, I've been using Netflix less and less. An idea I've seen getting tossed around a lot on the internet to explain this is that the splintering of streaming has led to Netflix losing a lot of its content to new sites. I think this is a reasonable explanation, but I don't think it's the full story. I think what we're really dealing with is that people have developed serious case of decision fatigue.

Netflix has always had to deal with the issue of choice overload, where the more options you're presented with, the more difficult it becomes to actually choose one. Take this phenomenon and stretch it out for the nine months of the pandemic and add the fact that very little new content is coming out due to said pandemic, people are just tired of having to make such a difficult choice over and over and over for so long.

With all these new streaming services coming around, I've watched people hop from service to service when new interesting shows come out on one or the other. What's interesting to me, is this feels very much like how we used to watch the tv. Aimless browsing until something cool comes on a specific channel, so you turn over to watch it. At this point, it feels like people are just longing to be able to turn on the tv and not worry about browsing through fifteen categories, reading reviews, checking which seasons are available on this service, etc etc etc

I think Netflix still has enough of a content library to be able to pull another game-changer. They should offer tv channels. They should just have constantly running streams for all the genres, they could even offer customized ones for your interests. No picking a show, just turn over to the streaming section and watch whatever's on. Don't like it? Change the channel. It feels weird to say that going back to the old style is a game-changer, but I really think it is. I would honestly love this. I think people really miss being able to mindlessly turn on the tv and just watch something.",0,2065,369

"Can't access Netflix on Firefox or Chrome... Edge and IE are OKHi Everybody,  


I've been trying to work out why I can't seem to access Netflix Australia on either Firefox or Chrome any more... while Edge and Internet Explorer are working fine.    


This is on my home internet connection (Australian NBN FTTN with Internode ISP).  I've tried Google DNS server [8.8.8.8](https://8.8.8.8) and Cloundflare [1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1) as well as my ISPs DNS servers.  


I'm not quite sure when started happening, but my Son complained about this about a week ago.

Both Windows 7 64bit and Win10 64bit machines on my network show the same symptoms.  I've tried disabling the Windows firewall, I don't have any other 3rd party network firewall or filtering in place.  


I can ping [netflix.com](https://netflix.com) just fine, but any attempt to access the Netflix Australia website with Firefox or Chrome results in a...

"Can't play one series on smart tvHello,

I have seen this issue before on reddit but none of solution proposed worked for me.

We have a Samsung smart TV (from 2018), we wanted to watch a series on Netflix and we get this error ""This title is not available to watch instantly. Please try again"" (code tvq-pb-101 (1.10.0)).

Every other movie or series work, the second season of the series work, the trailer of the series works. It's just the first season that get this issue.  


I tried restarting the smart hub, updating the system, unplugging the TV, reloading the app, turning off our internet connection, making the default parameter on the TV..... But nothing work. And I can't delete the app because it's a default app that can't be deleted.

Does anyone else have this issue ? How did you fix it ?

This issue persists throughout all my families devices, which are all iPhones (7,9 and X). Also, on a Samsung Tab. The issue doesn't arise on the Smart TVs or Desktop devices.

I have tried clearing cache/storage, checking if WiFi was disabled, and changing the DNS settings from Google's to Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 on my device (OnePlus 7T), but there has been no hope so far.

I have also contacted Netflix, directing me to my ISP, they told me to reset the router which I did, however the issue still persists, I contacted the ISP again and they are very to little help so I was wondering if anyone else has any other ideas. 

It does work on mobile data, and VPNs also work, but I'd rather not use those if at all possible.

It has worked before, but now, the subtitle language became German (I live in Germany). My whole Netflix account is English, the default language settings, as well as the subtitle language is set to English. Now when I preview a series and see the subtitle, it's in English as it should be, but when I click on the series and start the show, the sub is now on German.... How does that work? I don't think that it's possible, that they don't have an English translation. The question is if this whole thing has something to do with my location (Germany, as mentioned before) or with some glitch in the settings.
I'd be thankful to receive any help/useful feedback.
Thank you.",0,794,145
"The way netflix used to beRecently I've become frustrated with the way Netflix updates their user interface.. before at a glance you used to be able to see the year the film was made and it's rating out of 5 stars. Now you get 3 useless descriptors. I was thinking it would be more helpful to show their year and ratings from like Imdb or rotten tomatoes (because before their rating system was only from netflix users) and maybe even provide the link to those sites or just copy their brief description of the movie.

anybody else feel the same? Is there a way to change this in settings? Maybe we can rally and get netflix to actually provide useful info instead of the crap they give us?",0,690,128

Alien Worlds Source?I am currently watching alien worlds and am confused as to how they chose the characteristics of the life forms on the other planets. Are they just using it as an excuse to teach us more about cool traits of animals on earth? because if not then surely they should back up why these organisms look like that and why they‚Äôve chosen to give them these characteristics because so far in my viewing I have just seen these make believe organisms with no support to prove they would actually look like that on that planet.

"The toys that made us is pretty good.I grew up buying and loving those Ninja Turtle toys. The story of how they came to be is actually a heart warming, wonderful story between Kevin and Peter.

The whole thing just felt like an against the odds story that would be perfect for a movie.

I want a show that has in depth, developed characters who aren‚Äôt fucking straight.

"Sweet Home, I did not like it.

It's like a college essay, or maybe a bad adaptation of the webcomic which I will not read now because I watched and read Evangelion, Gantz, and some more, this series (Sweet Home) is as slow as it can, the monsters are there just because and you never take a lesson with you that's worth it. Yeah, the humans are worse than monsters is thrown in as you can imagine.

English subtitles for English dialogues in foreign language filmsI was watching a bunch of Bollywood movies and I noticed that when the dialogues are in English there are no English subtitles but they return when someone starts speaking Hindi. I don't need subtitles to understand the movies but I like having them on. English movies have English dialogues with English subtitles so what would they lose if they add a few more lines of subtitles. It's either the non Hindi speakers using English subtitles to understand the movie or people with some sort of hearing disability so isn't it unnecessarily inconvenient for them.,0,625,103

Since Netflix intruduced the new shot-based encoding, its streaming quality has drastically decreased on my machine.

There often are artifacts and I generally see a lack of details in the video. The image looks like a badly compressed JPEG.

It became very apparent during the final credits of The Queen's Gamit.  Here are some photos that I took (sorry for the bad quality, I couldn't take screenshots due to the DRM): [https://imgur.com/a/iVcrI9t](https://imgur.com/a/iVcrI9t)

My internet connection is very stable and reaches 300mbit/s.

Using the exact same setup some months ago, the quality on Netflix was fantastic. Now it's awful.

Just for comparison: if I stream in Chrome, the resolution is capped at 720p due to DRM . Then, I still get a bitrate of 600-700 (kbit/s I guess?). So it really doesn't surprise me that the quality in 1440p with a bitrate of 846 kbit/s is garbage.

**Other people facing the same problem**

It seems that I am not alone with this problem. Here are some sources complaining about this change:

&amp;#x200B;

**Solution?**

I searched the internet for quite a while but I couldn't find any solution. It seems that I am already using the ideal codec (HEVC). I also talked to Netflix via the chat but they weren't helpful at all. All their questions implied that the problem is on my side (what monitor are you using, have you installed all the updates, did you try using another browser, did you try connecting via an ethernet cable, etc.).

To me it seems there is only one solution: Netflix has to bump up the bitrate again. It's really a pity they are investing a lot of money in beautifully-shot series and then they screw it all up in the last step by streaming in a very low bitrate.

"'Virgin River' to Return for Season 3, Plus Netflix Announces Casting AdditionsNetflix's soapy drama Virgin River officially returns for Season 3 on the streaming platform.

Viewers can breathe a sigh of relief knowing that the burning questions posed in Season 2's finale are going (hopefully) to be answered. Returning for 10 additional episodes, expect to learn the fate of Jack (Martin Henderson), who was shot in the final moments of the last installment released.

Perhaps there's some reassurance in the fact that Henderson returns for Season 3 alongside Alexandria Breckenridge, Tim Matheson, Annette O'Toole, Colin Lawrence, Benjamin Hollingsworth, Grayson Gurnsey, Lauren Hammersley, Sarah Dugdale, Jenny Cooper, Daniel Gillies, Chase Petriw, Marco Grazzini, and more fan favorites.

Season 3 also makes way for two new characters as Zibby Allen (The Flash, Grey's Anatomy) and Stacey Farber (Saving Hope, Diggstown) join the fray. Allen recurs as Jack's sister, Brie who is a smart and ""ballsy"" lawyer. Farber portrays Lilly's (Lynda Boyd) daughter, Tara Anderson.

As fans recall, Season 2 of the drama saw Melinda Monroe (Breckenridge) return to the titular northern Californian town where she reconnects with Jack and continues to plant roots.

For now, there is no official premiere date for Season 3.

"Why dub the trailer/preview if the show isn't dubbed? (Sweet Home)I just binged Alice in Borderland and I enjoyed it. 

 I'm scrolling through the previews looking for the next binge candidate and Sweet Home pops up, preview rolls and it's dubbed in English.  I click it and look to change the language and there is no choice for English voice...  I've watched plenty of subtitled shows and movies and love them, but that's when all I'm doing is devoting my attention to the screen.  Sometimes I want to do other things at the same time as I watch tv so I want to hear it when I'm not looking at it.  

My problem isn't the show not being dubbed, it's being misled to think it was dubbed because the preview was dubbed.  It was just annoying to pick something to watch and have it turn out to be something I can't use the pc and watch at the same time.

Again, subtitles are great, I love them, what I don't like is a preview that's dubbed but the show isn't.

"I can't watch Netflix in 4k on Windows 10I am reposting this with some updates based on comments and Netflix support. Just for context, I posted about this issue around a month ago, responded with information that I didn't include in my previous post, and ended up contacting Netflix support. So I am reposting with updated information, in the hopes that someone will be able to help solve my issue. Post begins:

Some basic points:

* I am using the Windows 10 app, but I have also tested in Edge with no luck
* I have a native 4k display (LG CX)
* The resolution is set to 4k60Hz
* I have a supported CPU and GPU (i7-7700k, 1070 Ti)
* The GPU, monitor, and cable all support HDMI 2.0 
* ...Meaning not a bandwidth issue (I have also tested in other content)
* I have paid for and installed HEVC video extensions
* I have enough internet speed for it (300Mbps DL)
* GPU and display support HDCP
* I have the correct Netflix plan

And with all of that, I am still only getting HDR content on Netflix, NOT 4k. There is no ""Ultra HD"" tag on any content on Netflix, and the max I can get is 1080pHDR. I have confirmed this by using the debug stats, no matter how long I wait, it never transforms to 4kHDR.

And also, like I said above, I have enough bandwidth for it, the monitor supports HDMI 2.1, the GPU supports HDMI 2.0, and the cable is HDMI 2.0 certified. HDMI 2.0 has enough bandwidth for 4k, 60Hz, HDR, at 4:2:2 12 bit. I haven't had any other issues with any other content either. So not a bandwidth issue.

And yes, I have installed HEVC video extensions. Though I really shouldn't have to state this at all considering i'm playing HDR, but I know it will come up in the comments somewhere, which is why I would like to reiterate.

So, any ideas? At this point I meet all of the criteria, it's just... not working.

I have also contacted Netflix support and they agreed that I should be able watch 4k and ended up escalating the issue. So far I have not received a follow-up email despite the fact that I requested one, and my issue is still present, so I am going to safely assume that my escalated support request will have no results.

Also, since no doubt it will come up, I can't use the TV app for other reasons. I need surround sound through USB and my TV (the LG CX) doesn't do that, so I am stuck with the Windows 10 app.",0,2338,447

"Question: Security and Account SettingsI have had a netflix account since the days of prominent DVD rentals. I don't even know if streaming was an option back then haha.

I have a higher tier profile that allows multiple screens to view and currently have approximately 5 people in 3 homes that access my account. I have culled that way down from what it was in the past because of some bad actors making changes to my profile. However, this has not stopped which means it is someone who still has access to the account.

I have tried calling Netflix to see if I can identify who made the changes and to see if there are any USEFUL security measures that they can implement to help. The answer to both is no. I was given a PHYSICAL address to send a LETTER by USPS for submitting a complaint to their corporate office but this is obviously not an acceptable method since it's not 1964...

So here is my question, does anyone know of any 3rd party security software that might work to restrict access to changing account settings? Please do not tell me that I can simply change my password or that I can add locks onto profiles. The locks are entirely useless because they only lock viewing, not account changes.

"Talk me into keeping Netflix at this pointThe DRM properties have crippled any chance of enjoying a decent picture on a 43"" 4k TV.  I get Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+ for FREE with my wireless phone plan.  Someone convince me to keep paying a monthly fee to a company that seems hell bent on the worst possible user experience for their service?  I haven't watched a single episode of The Mandalorian, but I'm about to start!

What _does_ work, sorta: A Dex cable (usb-c to HDMI) from phone to TV. This will produce a picture, *but* it's locked to 480p. It's ok for animated shows like Big Mouth, but for movies it's a trash picture. Dark image, hugely pixelated, largely unwatchable.

Plugging a laptop into my TV, no dice. Will show the web browser, the Netflix site, and will even play the audio, but just a black square where the picture would be. Tried all 3 HDMI ports on the TV, tried in Firefox, Chrome, and even Edge...all the same. 

So before I cancel the subscription and raise the Jolly Roger up the mast, any ideas for a work around?  Any way to trick the Netflix app on my phone into displaying a higher quality output?  Any _reliable_ way to remove the idiotic HDCP from the signal?

Most of the movie is in English, but the English subtitles would not display if the parts are in English. It only display when it is a non-English part.

I have notice this for other foreign shows like Korean shows. When the actor/actress is speaking in English, the subtitles would not appear, only when they are speaking Korean. This is super infuriating for me, because sometimes the accent of the Actor/Actress makes the line hard to understand, or I am watching the TV in low volume at night.

Anyway to fix this?",0,686,116
"Dear Netflix, here are some problems with your service that I'm sure many can relate to.This is about the Netflix TV app, I don't know about PC or smartphone. I also know this is not an official netflix sub but I'm not sure where else I can post feedback that will receive actual attention.

1. I'm tired of adding movies to ""My list"" to watch in the future since half of the time they just disappear on me. For the love of god add an ""expiration date"" in the info or something.
2. You're going for quantity over quality. There's so much content that it's hard to choose what to watch anyway - it's a known ""issue"" that sometimes you end up scrolling and leaving, essentially not watching anything at all. Instead of making like 10 original productions a month or something make 2, but make them good. Your service is like a sprinkler, going all over the place. Eventually one of your competitors will give you a hard time if you won't change your attitude. One show that is liked by most people is much better than 50 shows that are liked only by some.
3. Excuse me but your recommendation system is a joke. I strictly leave a like on movies and shows that I actually REALLY like, but the content you push in my profile 90% of the time is not the content I'm interested in at all. I have to look for it myself, which can take a while, but when I do find something that I am really interested in, I'm thinking ""why the f\*\*k did I have to look for it this hard?"". I'm not going to compare you to Google because obviously they have a huge advantage when it comes to ""predicting what you want"", but still, when I open YouTube, I find something that interests me without looking for it, usually immediately. Try to be like that, don't just give me random stuff.

And that's basically it. I got used to issue #2 and #3 tbf, but issue #1 is the real reason for this post.",0,1867,354

"I hate the way Sugar Rush is organised and the series as a whole.As the title suggests I just hate the Series;

The judges are sometimes just boring.

Hunter is a very unpleasant host and has to constantly tell the judges what to do or narrate the entire episode.

I hate the way they work with the time feature; what I mean by that is, that all of them start with the same time but as soon as one finishes their first round everybody starts losing time because if you buzz your clock doesn't stop. Your clock keeps ticking even if you finished your first round. If for example every team would buzz at the same time the clock for your second round would keep going and you lose valuable time just because the judges have to get to every team to taste and explain etc. 

But what is really infuriating to me is that even if you get kicked out by the next round you'd still need to start with the second round. This even happens with the final round which is just insane to me since you may have already cakes in the oven or a finished buttercream and then you just leave the station while you already wasted resources and food for no reason whatsoever. 

This series just makes me angry since if you just wait between each round you wouldn't waste unnecessary resources etc.

Also, wanted to point out if the 2 taggers were also in the bombed building wouldn‚Äôt they have died as well making challenge 5 only passable by the others therefore just making the tagger dumbasses or murderers?

"The international popularity of non-English shows/moviesHi there,

I love the diverse cultures and countries involved in Netflix productions. I can watch a Spanish series without trying to find a subtitle, I can find many German shows to improve my listening skills, etc. However, I was wondering how popular are these non-English shows worldwide? Some shows like *La Casa de Papel* and *Dark* are very well-known but I am talking in general. Is there a source where I can find statistics on how much non-English shows are watched and liked in countries that do not speak the language? I discovered *Las Chicas del Cable* three years after its production, for instance. Almost everyone around me watched *Dark* but no one has watched *Wir sind die Welle*. 

Does Netflix bring different cultures together (in bold words) or do people just watch the shows/movies in their own languages and in English and ignore the other languages?",0,931,153

"AWAY, humanity's first journey to Mars, surpasses my expectation. However...There is too much emotion involved. I get that emotion and conflict is needed for drama, but i hate drama and i almost always skip when they start arguing lol. It is still very enjoyable nonetheless

It's surprisingly realistic, and the technology used isn't too far ahead of our own so it's pretty easy to relate. The microgravity scenes are on par with Apollo 13, which means it looks almost as realistic as the real one in International Space Station

.

#Minor spoiler alert :
The show has too much ""problem"" and conflicts, for my standard. But i imagine the general population will love it.

.

1st problem : the ""incompetence"" of the Commander, it is clearly a misunderstanding, anyone can make that mistake. A dying family member also won't affect the real professional that much. There is no way the real mars mission will have such a fuss over that problem.

.

2nd problem : Solar panel malfunction.  Even if 1 out of 3 solar panel malfunctioned, there is no reason for the entire crew to die as feared in the series. They can always redirect the power only for the essentials, even spacecraft from 1970 already have this function. The life and death situation of the spacewalk can easily be solved if only they have a SLIGHTLY longer tether -_- which is of course will be available in the real mars mission

.

3rd problem : water recycle malfunction, why does it fail so easily, they must've prepared them for decades with rigorous testing, i highly doubt such an important function will fail like that 

Aaand of course there will be cheeky romance in the spacecraft, which is... Not necessary(?) But yeah it increase the drama so i'll give it a pass",0,1739,303

"Queens Gambit started out strong, but turned into some dramatic garbage.Aight so queens gambit did start out as a great show. Lots of chess, very cool take with the orphan girl and her drug addiction but then how her drugs allow her to imagine chess boards on the ceiling and whatnot. Pretty dope shit. I enjoyed it, and I enjoyed all the good chess content. Then, once Beth Harmon grows up and *glows* up, and gets pretty hot, then all of a sudden the show just becomes about her fucking a bunch of losers. Like, any ugly nerdy chess dork who comes up and talks to her for more than 20 min ends up fucking her. And then she just gets hella wasted all the time and dances around and her undies. And then she fucks a woman because they talked for an hour or two. And then she gets fucked up more and dances in her undies more. 

Like bro what? Where‚Äôs the goddamn chess? You seriously gonna make this show a relationship drama show just because the actress is hot? You seriously gonna make her fuck anybody who comes her way just for the sexy chess pillow talk? 

One ugly nerd chess player who walks around dressed like a cowboy ends up fucking her. He cums, and then while he‚Äôs still inside her, doggy style, he starts talking about the Sicilian defense. Fuck you netflix, this isn‚Äôt what we wanted in a chess show. Just make it about fucking chess and have Beth Harmon kick some ass. You can add drama to embellish the story, but come on.

"Selena: The SeriesDoes anyone think positively about this show? I‚Äôm so tired of hearing people flame it.

I loved it. It took a deep dive into Selena‚Äôs past and showed how her career was a family effort. Although at times it did feel hyper focused on other characters, i think it did a good job of showing the making of each album and how each member of los dinos has their own little stories. The actress might not look exactly like Selena but they depicted her teenage hood well and got her style right. And i feel the ending was good too. It set up Selena‚Äôs Hit Como La Flor and i genuinely got chills when AB finally figured out the tune in his head and when Pete and Selena were writing Como La Flor. It also set up tension for Yolanda to come in season 2 as head of the fan club. I also think the foreshadowing of Abraham discovering Selena‚Äôs and Chris‚Äôs relationship was done pretty well.

"Questions about Dash &amp; LilyHey everyone so I watched Dash &amp; Lily a while ago and I can't shake certain questions the Top 3 would be:

2. How did she forget she was holding hands with Edgar in the elevator before the Christmas party when she is being asked if she has ever been kissed or held hands literally 10 minutes later?
3. How did the macys elf know when to deliver the keys to the front of the bookstore, did he simply wait in front of the bookstore for the whole evening?

I could go on for 17 more points but I made a whole video with 20 mistakes about it (linked on my profile here) but these questions are really still bugging me. Director mistakes or did I simply miss something? Thanks for the help this is no hate btw I did actually really enjoy the show itself.",0,927,177

"The Core (2003) is SURPRISINGLY great. Journey to the earth core to fix earth's electromagnetic field, this is one of those Science Fiction that was half possibleAs a science student, I really enjoyed it.

At least half the science is correct, living creature cannot survive without earth's natural magnetic field. The CGI is 2003 level of course, and there are several plot armor but overall the movie is great.

"Did Netflix recently start enforcing HDCP compliance??Hi all,

I personally don't have Netflix. But, have been tasked with trying to help the owner's mom with a problem they're having watching Netflix.

They've got a 2015 Mac Mini  hooked up to an  Acer al2016wb. This monitor only has VGA and HD-15 Dsub connctors. No HDMI whatsoever.

She said that things had been working. But, now when she tries to view Neflix, she gets the Netflix Error S7363-1260-48444350. A search for that error suggests the monitor is non-compliant, and someone else she talked with suggested it was her modem (how can a modem effect DHCP?!?!?)

She said they were also having a problem watching Netflix on their TV. But, she normally didn't do anything that that, so is going to have her husband call me back so we can talk further. I'm not 100% sure the TV is physically connected to the Mac Mini, or not. If not, that's obviously a different issue.

But, my primary reason for a msg here was to see if Netflix flipped some switch recently that caused her Netflix to stop running, when it had been working fine prior?",0,1096,192

"October 1 is a gripping story about a serial killer in Nigeria amid celebrations of Nigeria's Independence dayThe beginning is a bit slow, but it really picks up in the second half. It's much bigger budget than I had expected for a Nigerian film. The dialogue is great. Wikipedia calls it a dark psychological thriller film, but the interplay between the different police officers was fun, good dialogue with more than a few funny scenes.

Reading about it on Wikipedia, it's impressive how much cultural significance the movie holds too, openly discussing problems of colonialism as well as problems that come with independence and conflicts between different groups in Nigeria.

I'm partly just a fan of movies produced by other countries' film industries, and I would especially recommend October 1 to anyone looking to broaden their horizons, but I think it's worth watching either way. Just as long as you don't mind a few scenes of violence, etc.",0,952,158

The reason is that the show probably have one or two sex scene. What if netflix filters/removes these scene to decrease age limit so that the show can be available to more audience?

Christmas is coming along I want to give my mom Netflix for a year free or possibly forever. I live in California USA, she lives in Mexico.

This is Marwa ElDiwiny, the host of IEEE Soft Robotics Podcast. I host Latif Nasser lately on my show and other figures from scientific and political community to discuss how science shape our society. My dream is to make a TV show series about soft robotics, my show is only audio podcast, however, we managed to have audience from 60 demographic regions... I dont know if anyone here know a scientific producer or production company would be interested TV show series about soft robotics :)",0,533,89
"Alien Worlds , My thought going by the first episode I just watched. Its utter nonsensical garbage!Ok I was kinda looking forward to this show... I finally got round to watching it this evening.... And pretty much right away i started to get the prangs of doubt in the back of my head.

I first felt this as the introduction is painfully slow, going over basic science that for anyone interested in this topic is very well known common knowledge. 

Right away I realised who this show is aimed at.... And its not people who are even remotely educated. 

Now lets jump to the real meat of the problem.

The depictions and explanations of the alien wildlife are utterly nonsensical and do not conform to the well established norms of evolution or scientific understanding. 

While interesting the aliens only have the most vague of biological understanding of that of a random scifi tv show. Where you wouldnt need to go into the details for the sake of story plot. Why do these creatures fly? Because the writers say so. 

The very first assumption that these sky whales have 2 sexes is utterly insane. The only reason most creatures on earth have 2 sexes is because the earliest forms of life here evolved to have 2 sexes, and that then carried on to this day. nothing more. There is NO reason there couldnt be more or no sex at all. In fact its far more likely that alien creatures would reproduce asexually. 

Another issue I had was with the sky whales main predator. Some hydrogen filled balloon arsed leaches.... really WTF! Its soo far out the left field it too falls under poor science fiction.

Again the more likely predator would be another type of sky whale like creature. As it is with any other form of evolution. Most predators to mammals are other mammal.

Then there is the birthing of the creature.... Again WTF, that is utterly nonsensical to evolution again.

Yes sacrificial birthing happens in nature here too. But not when there is so few offspring and not with such large an animal that it takes huge amounts of energy to grow into that creature. 

Evolution simply does not work like that. Because its NOT viable. 

Oh and the frankly the most cringey moment I had was during the bug close up sex money shots!

With the film maker getting excited over it.

I come from a film background. I knew about slow up studio setups like this. And this isnt to slight the photographers. This kinda work is great and the BBC nature department does it all the time.

But the way this was edited together and shown for ... almost shock value? Cant think of the word I'm looking for. It really was cheap.

I might watch the second episode but I suspect it would be my last. 

Oh and Just want to say... The BBC actually did a show similar to this roughly 20 or so years ago. A what would life be like on other planets.... And I distinctly remember they didnt need to dumb down the science on that show, and they took the time to explain the likely biology of alien life in a clear and detailed way. 

&amp;#x200B;

So yes... Sadly regardless of the CG work gone into this, on scientific merit this show is utter garbage. You wont learn anything useful here, and in fact you may end up dumber by the end of it.

"Netflix Plans:Are the plans of Netflix worth the money each month. If the content isn‚Äôt improved should the plan price decrease. 

- Basic Plan ¬£5.99 Per Month
- Standard Plan ¬£8.99 Per Month
- Premium Plan ¬£11.99 Per Month

The basic plan includes one user watching at one time with one device having downloads, HD not available. For a whopping ¬£3 extra per month, two users can watch at the same time and two users can have downloads and you can watch in HD. The price for this should be a ¬£2 increase and the price should be ¬£5.99 a month for this plan which means the basic plan should be ¬£3.99. This would be a brilliant plan service. And all plans should include a three month free service if purchased for one whole year in advance. The premium plan allows you to watch and download on 4 devices and 4 users can watch at the same time, 4K is available but you must have a 4K Advice. Hmm, the devices and users watching should be unlimited at this price. This should be a ¬£3 increase. But the price should be ¬£8.99 not ¬£11.99 the prices should be decreased by ¬£2-¬£3 and the premium plan should have unlimited users watching at the same time.

"Stutters on second monitor with season 4 of ""Big Mouth""I usually put the Netflix desktop app on my second monitor (1080p@60Hz, HDMI) while doing stuff on my main monitor (1080p@240Hz, DP) and when I started streaming season 4 of Big Mouth just now, I noticed a weird thing:

It started stuttering really bad and skipping frames, as if it was only running at 20fps or even less. Once I moved the window to my main screen, everything was fine but when I moved it back it started stuttering again.

Season 3 and also other shows like South Park or Family Guy (earlier and later seasons) look fine on the second monitor, no stuttering, so far it only seems to be season 4 that's acting up. Edit: No stutters with season 4 if I use Firefox instead of the desktop app.

I used to watch ATLA in German and now German isn't available even though the overall language is set to German. The preview when I hover over the show is still in German though.

I wanted to watch Dracula just now and it was in German until I clicked on it, then it suddenly switched to English. Why is that happening? Is it intended? Did Netflix die in other countries or something that it's only English now? Or is it now location based (I'm in England)?",0,742,136

"Original Netflix characters lack creativityI think I noticed this first in Dead to Me and then again in The Haunting of Bly Manor. I feel like the characters are pulled straight from trending social media personalities without modification. They must see that these personalities have a following online and try to use that to draw in that specific crowd to watch their show. I mean I get applying relatable trends to your shows to make them appealing but it almost feels lacking in creativity. I feel like I already know the character before the character even does anything because I've seen it on social media thousands of times (specifically referencing the gardener in Bly Manor. She felt very copy and pasted from Instagram or Twitter)  not that there is anything wrong or uncreative about people with these personalities but I guess my personal opinion is that it makes for bad and boring TV.  I guess it is the way that they come off to be pandering to younger generations a little too hard that it seems inauthentic. Maybe I'm just getting old and shaking my fist.

Tl;dr original Netflix characters feel copy and pasted from the internet and it makes me cringe.

This never used to happen as I have fallen asleep on every series",0,405,75
"VIDEO GAME Anthology Series Idea! and Comment:I love a good anthology series, and everyone seems to at least love Black Mirror. But there's different tones you can hit on in a good anthology series. It doesn't always have to be scary, mind-bending, or deep. It can also be funny, touching, or just non stop action. For example, in the absence of Black Mirror I binge watched the following : LD&amp;R, Room 104, Creep-show, Outer Limits, and a few episodes of others. Sometimes I would watch these shows on one TV, while playing classic video games on another.

So it gave me an idea for a dope series that would be a platform for actors, writers, directors, and even a streaming service, to experiment with different IP's in a safe ""one off"" environment that requires no commitment to a full series, or second episode, unless the fans rejoice and demand it.

The series could explore a live action interpretation of a different video game IP every episode. So if they could get the rights to do it, a potential season line up could look like :

Episode 1 - Zaxxon

Episode 2 - Centipede

Episode 3 - Ninja Gaiden

Episode 4 - Double Dragon

Episode 5 - Spy Hunter

Episode 6 - Dead Space

That's just an example of course, not my dream team line up. I don't think it's realistic to assume they'd be able to get the rights to the most iconic IP's. At least not right away. If the series was successful enough, then you might see a trend of license holders willing to let their IP be represented in the show for a single episode.

Personally I would love to see a 1 hour rendition of Metroid, Mario Bros, or Legend of Zelda, in live action. And since Netflix already has the rights to a Castlevania series, I can assume it's somewhat realistic to imagine at least one live action episode based in that world.

So here's the catch (but also the benefit). A 1 hour long episode will not be able to summarize the entire depth of the character, or see resolution to their full story arc, or see the entire story of the video game unfold in live action. And I think that's a good thing. Too many Video Game IP deals go bad because they over commit in the beginning when they haven't even figured out how to represent the material in a digestible way. Then they are locked in to a weak representation of the IP that no one likes. At that point it doesn't matter if the deal was made for 1 episode or a movie, or 24 episodes. If it's bad then it's bad. The ""one off"" anthology approach is perfect. It allows people to experiment with an IP creatively and not be locked in to demanding framework like ""character arc"", and ""origin story"", and ""slow build up"" and so one. They also have a limited time to focus on one interesting aspect of that character's world and adventures. 

When my mind started swirling with ideas like this, I was fascinated by the potential episodes. Key moments or story arcs that happened within a small portion of an IP's total story, or universe.

Like the moment when Alucard nears the end of his adventure in Castlevania : Symphony of the Night, and has to face off with a succubus who makes him dream of his long lost mother.

Like when the giant centipede first attacks from centipede. Which could be a misdirection episode that builds up with character actor driven comedy, or drama, and results in a surprise ending with a giant centipede.

The moment when Link discovers the secret to an ancient flute that summons a whirlwind to take him further on his quest. 

The worlds are endless, the interpretations are near infinite. There would never be a moment in the series where the producers had to admit defeat and say ""we've run out of material"". 

Even if the series just focused on more affordable IP's in the beginning it would still be an almost endless well of material. The less established games actually provide MORE room for story, action, characters, that may have not been in the original game. 

I would love to see live action episodes featuring Rygar (Tecmo), Karnov (Data East), Black Tiger (Capcom). But maybe I wouldn't want to see a whole series on them, or even a full length movie. That's the beauty of the anthology format for these IP's. And if something doesn't work, then we just won't speak of it again, and we'll thank our lucky stars it was only a single episode.

Now finally before giving me your feedback, consider the framework for telling the stories in each episode. I had an idea of a siblings trying to survive some kind of apocalypse and there is no electricity anymore. Every night the older brother tells the younger sibling a story based on some old video game he used to play. He doesn't know any traditional bedtime stories but he knows all these games he's played growing up. Every episode is a different story the older brother would tell. This gives a bit of artistic license possibly, as it's not the IP directly being represented as is, but it's another character's version of it spun into a bed time story of some kind. This could be a set up for story used once, or every episode, or never. Just an idea. Although if this set up was used it could wrap the entire season up into one nice little story within a story and show us that they were in a video game IP all along. Some futuristic apocalyptic one. It could even turn out to be centipede lol. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm interested in other people's dream team line up for season 1 would be? What IP's would you love to see done in live action? And what would you want to see? What stories?",0,5511,1001

She knew he was alive and going to come for her). It got really exciting for a minute, but it missed the mark. I don't recommend watching this.

"Thoughts on Alien Worlds - Very DisappointedClearly not created by ecologists or people with a real understanding of living systems. Every creature is just ""alien version of earth animal"". Some of them are just HD pokemon like the literal monke that they created.

&amp;#x200B;

In the first episode, they have a creature that lands to lay it's eggs and dies. No natal care. They then go on to show how clever they are by comparing this to meerkats, which have a heavy investment of natal care as a species. A better example would have been an octopus, which lays it's eggs in a crevice or tiny hole in the ocean and then dies. Or the various salmonids that die after spawning. The main issue with a comparison like this, however, is that in order to ensure enough young survive to sexual maturity, they lay lots of eggs (some fish lay literally millions of eggs). The weird sky creature they depict doesn't appear to lay more than 20. Secondly, she dies right on top of the eggs. This would be a MASSIVE signal to predators and scavengers in the area that not only is there a tasty meal here, it comes with hors d'oeuvres.

&amp;#x200B;

I could break down every organism in this show and highlight the glaring flaws behind the supposed ""science"" that made them. In addition to this, they don't tie together on a way that makes sense on an ecological scale.

&amp;#x200B;

In the end it's just another pop-science special effects montage that makes superficial comparisons to life on earth without truly examining the way living systems function. Very disappointing but good to get baked and watch.",0,1599,279

"Did anyone else find the last episode of Queen's Gambit kind of weird?I really liked the show, but found the last episode a bit of a tone shift. Most of the series is pretty gritty and grounded, for the most part. It's obviously super character based, and does a great job of that. Beth is a really compelling character in the story. 

That said, I feel like the realistic tone and gritty drama atmosphere leaves as soon as she gets to Moscow. Then it suddenly takes a very Young Adult fiction atmosphere. The scenes with the crowds, all her friends getting together at the last minute, and even just things like the commentary and music were really campy. It felt more like a Harry Potter or Hunger Games film.

"So I Just Saw The Haunting of Bly Manor...I didn't really expect it to surpass *The Haunting of Hill House* because the bar for that one is quite high. *Hill House* is amazing, and I just love that series so much.

Then I saw *Bly Manor* and, though each episode wasn't consistently good as was in *Hill House* (it wasn't until *Bly's* 5th episode that the show really piqued up my interest and made me all ""ok, what the fuck is going on in this fucking place""), as a whole, and probably in the minority here, I like *Bly Manor* better. 

I like the balance of logic and emotion in this series. I'm the type of ghost show viewer who always has the ""Why is there a ghost? What happened? How can it attain peace?"" switch on, and I like my ghost stories to be more mystery/gothic, than pure horror, so I really appreciate the sequel &gt;!giving a few seconds to feature each of the ghosts and explaining how they got there, and then later on, they got their own happy ending by getting released. They didn't continue to get stuck there.!&lt;

"Deadly ClassSo the adaption of the graphic novel ""Deadly Class"" was just recently released on Netflix Germany and I gotta say: it's really good! Now it was released in Europe and apparently its in the top 10s for series in quite a few countries. After doing some research I read that for some reason it wasn't received too well in NA and so SyFy (the network that produced the series) didn't renew it for a second season. This is a real bummer, because I really loved the show so far and heard S1 is supposed to end in a cliffhanger.
I really hope I can get some of you to watch it and if it becomes popular in Europe, maybe NA watchers will really give it a chance and like it as well!

I don't have high hopes, but maybe Netflix sees the potential of the series and buys the license to renew it for a second season.

If not then it still was a great series and I might have to get the novels.

"Is cross-country sharing still allowed? [PL][ES]Hello everyone, today I was looking through Google if it's possible to share an account with someone from another country and the latest posts/links were from 2019. I prefer to be sure about this before buying a plan. 

Until November we were sharing an account with another friend (5 shared spaces, everyone Polish), he decided to cancel his subscription. We've decided to buy a 5 people plan as well and one of the interested people is my friend from Spain (to be exact, Catalunya). 

I've been finding mostly ""yes, you can share it with people from other countries"" although the first Google article is a big ""No"" from an US citizen (comment from 2017). 

I've read Netflix's ToS in Polish and then just in case re-read in English. The only rule I found was ""4.3. You may view Netflix content primarily within the country in which you have established your account and only in geographic locations where we offer our service and have licensed such content"". I know our libraries will be different and we don't care about that, it's just the matter of ""is it possible"". In my eyes, ""primarily"" doesn't mean ""exclusively"" so I'm thinking it should be fine for me to share account with her. Another friend said people were getting banned over this in the past, so I have my doubts now and that's why I'm asking.

"[SPOILERS] Queen Gambit is disappointingSo I've just finished binging Nerflx's Queen Gambit. First I've got to say that it kept me to the screen (over 4 days) so I don't consider it as a bad show. But (!) I find this show to be extremely disappointing of what it could have been. Felt like there wasn't enough emphasis on the chess itself. In most of the matches, all you see are the people with some split screens that suppose to make you excited (I guess?). Ok, so there were a few glances on the board itself, but it said nothing to anyone not familiar with the game.

I think the most challenging part of this show is to get people that aren't interested in chess to watch and enjoy it. I feel like they chose the easy way to do it by simply not putting emphasis on the game itself, without even explaining what is so exciting about some of the moves the players have made.    
Ok, so I know a bit of chess and I get it that many people don't, but take out the chess and put ANYTHING, and you could keep the show exactly the same. Come on, at least do some cool visual effects on the board to let the audience know about what is so cool with the moves, how it traps the opponent. Nada. 

All the series was going on neutral, without any real climax or suspense. Going into a show that you know how will it end should at least gives you some strong ups and downs through it.  Overall I think it's not bad at all, but I think it's way more overrated than what it needs to be.",0,1477,287

There was one episode where he (the man which I don‚Äôt remember the name) would go fishing, and other where he would do something with pottery, I think.

"Netflix app shows video in 4:3 aspect ratio on iPhone XHi all, on my iPhone X, the Netflix app sometimes shows videos in a 4:3 aspect ratio. This often cuts off a good portion of the left and right hand sides of the video (depending on the original ratio). I can get around this by pinching in. This makes the sides pop out to the correct ratio, but the bottom and top get cut off (if it‚Äôs not widescreen).

Since upgrading to iOS 14, I have been able to us PiP with the correct aspect ratio, but when going back into the app it goes back to the 4:3 ratio. 

This has been happening on and off for a long time (probably almost 2 years at this point), so I rule out any OS changes causing this. 

I also can‚Äôt figure out any pattern to which shows/movies it decides to make 4:3. I have deleted and redownloaded the apps multiple times to no avail.

"Does anyone else feel disappointed with content Netflix wide this year? In a really general sense?I don't have an issue with the originals they have released, however I feel like 2019 and 2018 had some really incredible shows and movies. 
I remember multiple times where I would wake up every day, really excited to see if there was something new and interesting on, and there was! Almost a weekly basis at times something great, or at least entertaining/exiting, would come out once a week or bi-weekly. 

TV is my vice, I really enjoy a great TV show. I felt the Netflix subscription was worth every penny. 
This year however, the price went up and I feel like there have been entire months where nothing interesting came out. 
On top of that, a few of my favorite shows got discontinued. I have some Netflix Original animes I am scared to look up in fear I find they have been cancelled too. 
I have watched a lot of foreign/international shows and movies to make up for it, maybe in genres that werent my first choice. I don't wish to complain, as I appreciate these shows a lot and they've fulfilled my cravings for good TV. However I miss when it was back to back scifi releases, and the writing quality was really high. 

They've done some cool stuff with zombies this year. 
Idk. 
I'm worried now they'll cancel Kingdom too, which is my favorite show right now that's still actually running. It's crazy that they are making so many subscribers anxious. It feels like the only sure thing is another season of Ozark.

"[CAN] Not getting 4K or HDR.So I just got a new TV (Sony OLED) and I've just upgraded my plan to 4K. In both my TV's native Netflix App and the one on my Xbox One S, it seems to be serving me 1440p at less than 1mbps bitrate (Queen's Gambit). I do see the Dolby Vision icon in the title display.

The TV doesn't seem to think I'm getting HDR content either, and I've tried this both with Netflix Certified mode on and off.

I have a solid 40-50 Mbps connection.

With Prime Video I seem to be good to go with HDR and Dolby Vision with the Android TV app.

"CC 2 is an awful film.I just finished watching The Christmas Chronicles 2, and I have to say that it is objectively a bad film. Now, before people start coming at me telling me it‚Äôs a kids film and it‚Äôs not meant for me, save your breath. Is that any kind of excuse really? There are so many amazing kids films out there, and even if I don‚Äôt necessarily enjoy one of them. I can usually appreciate the strong writing or relatable characters. 

But this film is just terrible. The writing is crap, the acting is even worse and Netflix being Netflix just had to virtue signal again with the line ‚Äòit should be called Mrs. Claus‚Äô village‚Äô. Really? You‚Äôre a something year old young child and that‚Äôs the first thing on your mind seeing this magical Christmas village? I was honestly expecting Santa to die so that Mrs. Claus could really start being an empowered woman. 

Anyway, I just thought this was another shit jewel in Netflix‚Äôs crown. 

Also, who keeps hiring Julian Dennison? The guy can not act his way out of a paper bag. I would say he‚Äôs a words actor than Ruby Rose, but that isn‚Äôt a hard feat to pull off. That guy was definitely hired because of the way he looks. It was a diversity hire, certainly not a talent one.

"Star Trek : Discovery - watched the first 5 minutes and can't bare watching moreThe movie starts on a planet where a Starfleet command and their 2nd in command help some natives get some water. On their way to the village, the 2nd in command knows the way but refuses to tell their superior officer by playing the 'haha what you don't trust me?' game. 

They do the deed and a storm which the 2nd in command predicted up to the second comes in 1hr early. That's when the commander asks the 2nd to follow her, cause she has a plan. Which obviously she won't tell, playing the 'haha you don't trust me' game as well. 

She tells the 2nd she's gonna get her own ship, then as they walk while the 2nd questions the commanders decision to go that way. It is revealed that they were drawing the Starship emblem all along so that the ship can see them from low orbit. 

Can anyone tell me why do these people act like incompetents? They go on a strange planet and only one of them knows the way to the village, then they keep information from each other like they are a couple of teens playing games instead of Starship high ranking officers. The one who is due a promotion to be a captain doesn't even know that she could be rescued by drawing in the sand, how can one be so stupid and become a commander?

"I actually liked The I-Land by NetflixIs it so crazy to say that this show actually wasn't the worst show ever made? I've read the reviews about bad acting, terrible plot, weird camera angles, and inconsistency but here's what I think. If you watch this show from a simpler mindset rather than expecting it to be A1 on all fronts because its Netflix made then it might be more enjoyable. The acting wasn't all that bad, people's facial expressions sold me more than the words. The plot was meant to tell the story of Chase, all the others just got sucked in but that was fun to see too. Weird camera angles? I mean sometimes but for the most part it was pretty spot on. Let me know what you guys think, I want to discuss this and understand why people think it's so bad and I also want to see people who really liked it. Let's start a discussion!",0,846,160

"Rant: an unwanted trailer just ruined the first series my partner and I both enjoy(Contains spoiler)

My partner and I have different TV tastes so have never really got on with a series we both like. However we recently started watching house of cards, she‚Äôs really into it, I was surprised and glad, because I was too.

Skip forward to tonight, we‚Äôre on S1 E5 and while we‚Äôre getting settled in to watch, she‚Äôs hovering over the House of Cards icon when it starts to auto play a trailer; immediately we scramble to cancel but instantaneously see Frank‚Äôs wife making a presidential speech... presumably many seasons down the line.

You would have thought with all the AI and algorithms these tech companies brag about to predict what you like they‚Äôd figure out showing someone on season 1 a future seasons trailer with spoilers is a bit stupid.

"Hard Kill is a hot mess. So sad it ""stars"" Bruce WillisI'm just gonna tag this with spoiler and nsfw.

First, let's talk dialog.   It's cheesy.  It's soo cheesy.   But it's also boring cheesy.   We first watched Bruce Willis action movies for lines like ""Yippie Ki Yay, Mother Fucker!!""  Here we get lines like ""Stop.  I'll give you the code.""   I think that is literally the longest and strongest line he has in the entire movie.

It's like the entire script was generated by Alexa, Siri, and Cortana when asked ""what are lines from an action movie?""

Then there is the plot.  Spoiler alert: an international terrorist with unlimited funding and unlimited minions to sacrifice has a Bad Thing and a billionaires daughter as a hostage.  Does billionaire contact the US government, to get Seal Team Six, the CIA, the NSA, Jack Ryan, or Jason Bourne involved?   NOPE!!   He goes to his completely incompetent chief of security to hire a barbershop-quartet of former commandos-turned-mercenaries with no real equipment or backing.   Then they deceive them into falling into the same trap that he knows is a trap but where somehow he is the bait.  The result is the terrorist has already scoped out the environment, placed security cameras, basically has the whole place surrounded.

Then there is the action.   Lots of gun battles.  Good guys never miss, bad guys (almost) always miss.  Also, good guys and their wounded retreat to some super-secret room they found by accident, that again somehow the bad guys, despite having had blueprints to the entire site (there's that whole plot thing again!), somehow cannot find!

Finally, production and continuity was sooo bad.  Starting from the limo at the beginning, which didn't have a door up front from the outside, but everyone enters the limo from the door up front.  To characters somehow walking down spiral stairs in some kind of tower, immediately after being in the basement.

Last point, Bruce Willis.  He glares.  A lot.   He glares while sitting in a limo.  He glares while sitting in a chair.   He glares while standing alone in a closet.   I can only guess when he got the final version of the script, he hated it so much he refused to participate.",0,2207,373

It is a new stop-motion Christmas short that showed up on Netflix this week. The creators were the Chiodo brothers. That name might not seem familiar to most, but they designed the Critters aliens back in the '80s and also made the massively fun Killer Klowns from Outer Space. They have done FX on tons of things over the years too. This 42-minute short is done in that old school Rankin/Bass look and the animation is fantastic. The story is fun too as it chronicles a little alien named X who comes from a race of kleptomaniac aliens to steal everything during Christmas.

"Shot Caller (2017)(US)- A Gut Wrenching Movie That Doesn't Get the Recognition it Deserves (X-Post to r/Movies)While the movie isn't perfect, it far exceeded my expectations. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau is *fantastic* in this film, everyone knows him as Jaime Lannister, but he fell right into the role of Money. Seeing his descent from innocent businessman to skinhead gang leader is brutal to watch. Going into the film I thought it would just be another violent B-movie, but the production is honestly stellar. The cinematography, the score, the special effects, and the acting are all superb. Most films have an underlying ""theme"" that is usually second to its entertainment value, but Shot Caller did a tremendous job showcasing how hard it is for someone to truly get rehabilitated in prison. Nikolaj's character is just doing what he has to to survive and protect his family, all the way up to becoming the head-honcho. It's been a long time that I was so invested in the world of a movie that I was sad when the credits rolled, simply because I wasn't ready to leave.

&amp;#x200B;

Narratively I understand the movie is pretty divided. The film doesn't go to great depths to explore all of Money's decisions or what exactly his motives are, but I thought it was adequate enough, and it all made sense to me. Other than the dumb title and the aforementioned narrative flaws, I think it's a perfect film. I really don't think it gets the recognition it deserves, but from what I understand, that stems from distribution issues. If you are a fan of prison movies, I can't recommend this enough. If you have seen this, I would love to hear what you think, because I personally loved it.",0,1685,291

This documentary took a whopping 8 years to be filmed and edited, it's about 3 hours long (with 2 episodes) and even though it's obviously sad, it's very very very well made and touching. I highly recomend this doc, as it offers a view on the family and on the doctors who are doing everything to improve the patients quality of life.

To those who have seen this documentary I have a question: do you guys know anything about how the families and children are now? I really wanted to know how they're doing. I'm sure much has changed since 2006 and I'd like to know.

After winning the final match and sitting in the car on their way to the airport, Beth decides that she wants to ""walk"" and instead of telling her she's out of her mind, the agent simply says ""You're going to miss your flight!"" and does nothing to stop her as the car pulls away, leaving her alone on the cold winter streets of Moscow.

Watch ""We are the Champions"" - Totally fun and binge worthyI just started watching this ""We are the Champions"" mini series last night without much expectations and thinking I'll stop it after 5 mins. But was really amazed by the series. In each episode, they show a quirky and eccentric championship game that are held across the world in small communities. It's really light and fun. I didn't know about any of these games/championships. So far I have seen 4 episodes.

1. Cheese ball rolling competition that happens in a village in England. This one was really fun to watch.
2. Chilli Eating competition. THIS IS AMAZING! You are gonna feel the heat just watching them eat those chillis
3. Fantasy Hairstyling competition, apparently happens in New Orleans where hair dressers create crazy looking hairs for african american people
4. Yo-Yo competition: Competition about young kids taking yo-yo so seriously, there is a big championship around it.
5. ... yet to watch

"I can't watch Netflix in 4k on Windows 10Just some points before I start:

* I am using the Windows 10 app
* I have a native 4k display
* The resolution is set to 4k60Hz
* I have a supported GPU (at least I think: 1070 Ti)
* The GPU, monitor, and cable all supports HDMI 2.0 
* ...Meaning not a bandwidth issue (I have also tested in other content)
* I have paid for and installed HEVC video extensions

And with all of that, I am still only getting HDR content on Netflix, NOT 4k. There is no ""Ultra HD"" tag on any content on Netflix, and the max I can get is 1080pHDR. I have confirmed this by using the debug stats, no matter how long I wait, it never transforms to 4kHDR. And since I forgot to mention, yes I have enough network speed for it.

And also, like I said above, I have enough bandwidth for it, the monitor supports HDMI 2.1, the GPU supports HDMI 2.0, and the cable is HDMI 2.0 certified. HDMI 2.0 has enough bandwidth for 4k, 60Hz, HDR, at 4:2:2 12 bit. I haven't had any other issues with any other content either. So NOT a bandwidth issue.

And yes, again, I have installed HEVC video extensions. Though I really shouldn't have to state this at all considering i'm playing HDR in the first place, but I know it will come up in the comments somewhere, which is why I would like to reiterate.

So, any ideas? At this point I meet all of the criteria, it's just... not working.",0,1392,270

Is there a way to change this so English is included? I cannot fathom why Netflix would do something this absurd and asinine.

Watching 'Undercover' right now for example. I have to crank the volume way the fck up during English language dialog so I can actually hear them, and then turn it back down again before some deafeningly loud sound effect pierces my ear drums.

"American Horror Story is legitimately one of the worst shows I‚Äôve ever seen.I have given this series several attempts now and good lord. It is abysmal. 

So before I dive into my rant, the reason why I‚Äôve tried to watch it several times is because it has so many of the things I love. Horror, mystery, supernatural/fantasy elements. Not to mention it is littered with great and established actors and actresses. 

Now that being said, I watched the first two seasons when they originally aired because my girlfriend loved it. To me, there were brief moments of intrigue or suspense but mostly it was one eye-roll after another. I stopped watching after that. 

A couple years later, my friend convinced me to watch the ‚ÄúFreak Show‚Äù season, after he repeatedly told me how awesome it was. I lasted three episodes and again, it was painful. So many cliches, poor dialog, predictable events, etc. Not to mention I hated the setting of that season. I chalked it up as a loss and never looked back. 

Now in 2020, Netflix has been shoving it in my face for days now. As I originally stated, this is definitely the type of show/movie I normally watch, so I get why their algorithm is ramming it down my throat. I reluctantly decided to start watching it yesterday.

Started with ‚ÄúHotel‚Äù. Got bored before the second episode ended. Tried to watch the season with Cuba Gooding Jr (forget the name) and it was so bad that I nearly stopped there. The Apocalypse season was also laughably terrible. 

I decided to give it one more shot just now and watched 3 episodes of ‚Äú1984‚Äù. Holy shit, that was also downright trash. 

So after watching two full seasons and pieces of several more, these are my observations:

1. The script and dialog are absolutely terrible. Even when there is a briefly captivating moment, it‚Äôs usually ruined by some cheesy and basic dialog. 

2. I have NEVER found a single character that I liked. No one to root for. No one who I want to live and succeed. Couldn‚Äôt care less about ANY of them. Obviously that‚Äôs a problem in a series where people are dying every episode. 

3. The stories are so uninteresting and this largely goes back to my second point, the characters are garbage. I don‚Äôt care about their backstories. The central plot is always just a ‚Äúmeh, if it happens, it happens‚Äù type of feeling. 

4. Even when I suffered through the episodes to get to a big reveal or finale, it was lame as fuck. The mysteries all wind up being nonsense, the big reveals are idiotic and again, I NEVER GAVE A SHIT ABOUT THE CHARACTERS. If you can‚Äôt even get mildly invested in the protagonists, what the hell is the point? 

There are many other gripes I have with this damn show but I don‚Äôt want to ramble on further. If you like it, I‚Äôm happy you get enjoyment from it. I don‚Äôt however and I was so frustrated with it that I had to make this post to vent my frustration. 

If you managed to read the whole thing, thanks for your time.",0,2946,532

"Has anybody watched Midnight Diner (subtitled)? Wow, what a different type of program!Stumbled across it tonight and it‚Äôs so... wholesome and enjoyable to watch!

A character comes into the diner at midnight, and the episode revolves around their story. It‚Äôs simple but refreshingly so, a bit like a palate cleanser from a lot of the high octane, over-produced TV on today. 

Only watched a few episodes so far but it‚Äôs so far away from what I‚Äôd normally watch... episode 2 really caught me unawares and I hope the rest of the series brings such emotional and *nice* stories with more great characters. 

Wow, completely blown away!",0,632,106

"4k Streaming on Windows 10 Suddenly Stopped WorkingHi - 

So I was able to get Netflix in 4K working on my Windows 10 PC using the app, and by installing the HEVC Video Extension.  Worked perfectly until maybe about a week or so ago, and now I get terrible studdering.  It's totally unwatchable.  I've tried reinstalling the app, reverting to a ""stable"" GPU driver, reinstalling the HEVC app (I can't seem to figure out how to revert to older versions).  Nothing seems to work. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can watch 4k outside of netflix no problem in apps like VLC.

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing I've been able to figure out is it looks like the video decode utilization keeps spiking up and down.  The spikes are associated with when the 4k video is playing.  See here: [https://imgur.com/a/yVwd1mF](https://imgur.com/a/yVwd1mF)

The show started with a main character getting transported to another world (uncertain) and he had a gem stone that could summon allies, or monsters I don't really remember. He had two friends that consisted of a ginger female and a dude with dreads. The main character himself had brown hair I think, but they all had gem stones that could summon something, that was the main gimmick of the show.

I've noticed an inconsistentcy in netflix between devices recently.
Certain shows are showing up on my PC, and not on mobile. Those same shows are also available on my xbox app.

Inversely, Disney+ is the oposite.

For instance, Marvel: Agents of SHIELD is available on my PC, but not my phone, on netflix, while it's available on D+ on the phone, not the PC.

Right now, my best guess is that because I'm running Cloudfare WARP on my PC, as well as using the Cloudfare DNS on my router settings, it's re-routing the DNS querries for the hardwired devices on my network. But why not on the phone, since it's on WiFi on the same network. Unless the phone app uses geolocation.

There can be plenty of action and fighting and violence but no kissing or sexual relationships because my dad won't allow it. *The Flash* and *the Arrow* are some of my favorite shows but I'm not allowed to play that on family Netflix nights because they have too much kissing (Barry and Iris, Jessie and Wally in the Flash). I also loved *Merlin,* and I am allowed to play that show on family movie nights because there isn't almost any romance or kissing. My favorite genres are fantasy, action, spy fiction, superheroes, sci-fi maybe (though I have never tried sci-fi). A requirement is that it must have a lot of action and at least something that isn't realistic (like superheroes, scifi, or something like that).

I just finished watching Jingle Jangle and I have to say it is an absolute mess of a film. This is the kind of film making that doesn't trust its audience. 
I love Christmas films but this one is so full of nonsense, schmaltz and unnecessary additions that the underlying story is lost. They shove the message of believing down your throat so often it losing impact and spend little time developing characters.
The music is terrible and often takes you out of the world they created. If you do a musical the songs need to develop the plot and several of them in this are just tacted on.
The writing is poor and they throw several references in that completely break the the 4th wall.

so i feed my newborn every few hours at night and im usually up for an hour afterwards (so im up for usually around an hour and a half to two hours every 4 hours, you know how it is if you have a kid lol).  ive taken to watching anime during these times.

**watched:**

-Bleach  

-Inuyasha

**watching (not during feedings):**

-Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

-Cells at work

**not interested in:**

-Seven Deadly Sins

-things with excessive lewd stuff (prefer little to none) or that rely on sexual humor

-movies

I also prefer full series, i didnt know they didnt have the entirety of Bleach  (up to when it was cancelled ofc) or Inuyasha until I basically finished what they had.  Ill still watch a series even if its not completely on there.

Ill give anything a chance as long as its not extremely lewd or sexual or a movie (just cause i tend to leave the show running while i go to sleep).  No lewdness or sexual stuff is because my self esteem is awful right now due to just having a baby and i dont want to end up having to wake my partner up at 3am to ask him if he still finds me attractive lol",0,1153,214

"Netflix's premium plan is one step short of a scamSo I subbed to a premium plan this month since I bought a 4k monitor for myself, I thought ""hey, I should treat myself to the best quality possible"". Little did I know, that to achieve that quality I would have to jump through 10 burning hoops and do a somersault. 

Apparently, just paying for the plan and having a 4k monitor is not enough. Here's a list of things that you also need:

1. The right browser (Edge) or the native windows app
2. A monitor that supports HDCP 2.2  and a cable that supports it
3. A codec from windows store that costs $1 for some reason
4. The latest windows update
5. Connection speed of at least 25 mbps (this one is pretty obvious, but I thought that you could download videos in 4K. Disclaimer: you can't, downloads are capped at 1080p)
6. If you have multiple monitors, and one of them doesn't support 4K/HDCP 2.2, you can't stream in 4K, even if you primary monitor is compatible

And on top of this, there is never an indicator of the quality of the video (like in YouTube for example), so you can never tell if the video just doesn't have a 4K version, or your setup is wrong. There is no easy way to troubleshoot your setup. But the most annoying thing is, all these little things are **NOT MENTIONED** on the official website anywhere. For some reason, 3rd party websites have to provide this information.

So basically, there is this list of not so obvious requirements for you to stream in 4K, but Netflix doesn't care to make sure you can actually get what you paid for. I personally think this is ridiculous. It's like ""yeah, we got your money, now go figure it out yourself if you want 4K that bad"". For $16/month, they should have a bloody hotline for people with these issues honestly, and a wiki page.

I'm lucky that my setup actually fits these requirements so all I had to do is spend a couple of hours googling and meddling, but not everyone is going to have the same experience. Apparently, you can't stream 4K on a Mac at all? What the hell is that?

"Why do book readers insult Netflix enjoyers?Okay, this post is coming from someone who grew up around parents, teachers, and piers who looked down upon television yet loved books. In response, here are the similarities between television and books:

1. They are both sedentary entertainment media
2. They can both convey complex plot and character development within fiction 
3. They can both be used as tools for education
4. Depending on the program, a TV show can use the same vernacular as a written piece (Think David Attenborough documentary)

If they are so similar, why do readers tease television watchers? Why can't we enjoy what we enjoy? Why can't we try another form of media?

 \- I believe it's international... The voices of the characters sounded like they might be voice overs.

\-Possibly set in the victorian era...perhaps maybe about royalty

\-In the scene there is a man shooting plates or birds and there is a woman telling him that some other man is back and that she couldn't believe she was being set up to marry him. The man seemed disgruntled about it almost like he was jealous of her

"Please Watch 'The Repair Shop'!! This feel-good reality show has been keeping my wife and I sane during the pandemic, and it is slated to leave‚Äìand potentially never come back on December 1st.It's so wholesome and fascinating. I tear up basically every episode when people see their stuff looking just like they remember it from their childhoods. The lack of staged drama and arguing has set the bar for all other reality shows for us, it's such a nice change of pace, and I don't think we can ever go back!

They have already shot several other seasons, so I'm really disappointed it's going away, instead of having more episodes added. And in case you were curious like we were, everyday people apply to have their items fixed on the show, the producers pick the ones with the best stories, and the team fixes them up for free!  Soooo cool, we love it!

The topic of this series seemed very  interesting to me. And  I jumped on it when it came up on my feed....But to me it is unwatchable. I skipped ahead to check out other episodes,  but no.

Not sure if it's all rotoscoped or some such filter or it is all animated with voice overs? IDK. What I do feel is that I'm watching a game that  I can't interact with. And also worry this is  a new generation of films where actors aren't needed and the voice actors will soon follow.

"A Lion in the House, an old doc new on netflixI'm not always interested in older docs, but I am glad that I gave this one a chance.  It was filmed in the late 90's and follows several children and teenagers diagnosed with cancer.  It is definitely a hard thing to watch, but I think it is worthwhile viewing to see the strength of these patients and their family and the hospital staff.  Seems like a lot of people know a family going through this, or donated to a go fund me, but this doc really lays out what these people are going through that a lot of people don't want to think about.

An interesting element of the film is the denial of the parents, and the amount of power they have over the treatment over their child, even when doctors don't agree.  I don't blame these parents, I kinda understand it, but one family in particular is in such denial, and trying to avoid all real conversations by making stupid unfunny jokes, that you really feel for the staff and step mom trying to talk some sense into them as gently as possible.

Anyways, I thought it was riveting.  If you have 4 hours maybe give a chance.",0,1119,210

"I wish they‚Äôd hire better voice actors for dubbed seriesI recently watched Dark, a German series which I thoroughly enjoyed.  Most of the voice acting was ok but some of it way off (actresses who sounded 30 talking for old ladies etc) but today I‚Äôve started Love and Anarchy and it‚Äôs almost unwatchable. It seems like all of the voice actors have forgotten the ‚Äúactor‚Äù part of the job description. The dialogue is so unnatural and the voices seem so off (the main actress sounds like some kind of stoned preppy cheerleader when clearly she‚Äôs meant to be a commanding business woman and her genuine Swedish voice is much deeper). It honestly sounds like high school drama, the way they read from the scripts in such a forced way. I‚Äôve never done any voice over work so I don‚Äôt know what challenges they face but do they not get to at least see the scene so they‚Äôre acting for? Sometimes the ‚Äúacting‚Äù will be so dramatic compared to what‚Äôs actually happening on screen. Other times it‚Äôs the opposite. It absolutely grates me and makes a good series practically unwatchable in my opinion. Surely Netflix have the budget for slightly higher quality voice actors?!",0,1159,203

"Help finding a documentary on Trump where one of his business associates tells a guy that Trump is mentally ill (not #UNFIT)Sometime earlier this year (don't remember when exactly), I saw a documentary that I believe was on Netflix (but could be on any of the major ones; I use them all and can't remember where I saw it) where someone recalls learning that one of Trump's business associates says that Trump is mentally ill. I thought it was #UNFIT (on Amazon), since that is the whole topic of the film, but I just rewatched that one and this scenario wasn't in it.  

The scenario (which I'm paraphrasing because I cannot remember all the details): someone hoping to do business with Trump (long before he ran for president) is in a meeting negotiating with him, and Trump says a bunch of random stuff and can't seem to stay on topic. After the meeting, one of Trump's business associates is showing the guy out and the guy asks ""what was that?!?"" and the associate says ""you have to understand that \[Trump\] is mentally ill.""

"""I have a HDR screen and it's all so dark"" explanation - no, it's not exactly your screen's faultThis is going to be long, but hopefully worth your time.

First, the basics. HDR - obvious. SDR - standard dynamic range. SDR screen means a regular, non-HDR tv/monitor.

Common misconception is that HDR is all about brightness - that's true only to a degree. HDR content has both higher maximum brightness as well as higher precision within smaller dynamic range, but that higher brightness is used mostly for really bright light sources.

Another common misconception is that you need the brightest possible HDR screen to do HDR content justice. That higher brightness will show those bright spots better, but if your screen isn't 1000 nits, but for example 600 or even less, it does NOT mean that everything should get darker because of it. That's not how it works. HDR-capable video player, for example built-in netflix player in your tv, is calibrated towards your screen. In case of a PC, you need to take care of that calibration yourself. Basically, video player needs to know your screen's maximum brightness to display HDR content properly. If there are details in the picture that are very bright, for example between 800 and 1000 nits, and your screen's maximum brightness is 600, those details will suffer (they won't be gone though, because of the tone mapping), but everything else will be just fine.

But here's the thing. SDR content is expected to be 100 nits max. Blame the old crt tvs and so on, that's how it is to this day. As a result, tv content is mastered with that in mind - that most of the picture should be within 100 nits range. People that don't have HDR tvs, usually are watching it at a much higher brightness - minimum for inexpensive SDR tvs/monitors these days is around 250-300 nits. Picture gets blown out of proportion contrast-wise, colors get messed up, but it looks ""punchy"" and reasonable, so everyone got used to it.

SDR content has no notion of brightness higher than 100 nits.

HDR can go much, much higher.

But how is HDR tv content mastered? Similarly to SDR content... so that the average is around 100 nits.

That's why, when you're used to watching SDR movies at 300 nits, when you'll watch something in HDR that's mastered towards 100 nits average (to have huge headroom for much brighter highlights), it seems darker - because IT IS, compared to how you were watching things in SDR. The whole industry should throw that 100 nits standard out of the window and start mastering things towards 200 nits at least, but that's just IMHO. It is what it is, it's not HDR's fault.

But here's another thing, it isn't exactly worse. Sometimes the picture may seem just darker, but often there's higher relative contrast between different things, not even mentioning wider color gamut and higher precision.

Below are 3 series of 3 screenshots each. First one is SDR - standard, maximum brightness SDR. Second one is SDR displayed at 100 nits on a 250 nits SDR screen. Third one is HDR tonemapped to 250 nits - meaning, whatever is in the HDR content that's below 250 nits, gets reproduced accurately, while everything above gets ""squeezed"" to the top of that 250 range. This is SDR screenshot, so HDR color precision is lost there, but you should be able to get a fairly realistic idea about the difference between SDR and HDR in this case, even if you have only SDR screen. Also, it gets obvious that HDR content targets 100 nits on average when it comes to the average brightness - confirming the above ""why is it so dark"" explanation.

First series:

[https://i.imgur.com/sZ6637S.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/sZ6637S.jpg)

Hard to tell how HDR is any better at all, right? Next one then:

[https://i.imgur.com/FssG9Ep.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/FssG9Ep.jpeg)

Now here it is quite obvious. Second SDR screenshot is the same as the first one, only darker. While the brighter version may look fine, in reality it's just a blown out of proportion low contrast picture compared to HDR.

And the last one - warning, very slightly NSFW.

[https://i.imgur.com/Rz2J8EI.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/Rz2J8EI.jpeg)

[https://i.imgur.com/taMhzQq.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/taMhzQq.jpg)

The difference is obvious.

""But every tv has a brightness setting, what will happen if I'll crank it up to the max?""

Well, that depends on your tv's maximum brightness. HDR content needs much higher brightness for highlights. If your tv has a maximum brightness of 600 nits, the average brightness for the examples above may go up from 100 nits to roughly 125 nits max, meaning it'll still be considerably darker than SDR content displayed on the same tv. That's just the way it works. Screen with a maximum brightness of 1000 nits would bump up that average brightness to 200 nits at best. Also, how the tv interprets that brightness setting on its maximum level, most likely depends on the tv. HDR content specifies exact brightness of each pixel of the picture, up to 1000 nits and more. If the tv bumps up the reference 100 nits brightness up to 200, it has less headroom to properly show those brightest spots, partially defeating the whole purpose of HDR.

""But you've said that less maximum brightness doesn't mean darker picture!"" - as long as the display is calibrated properly, 100 nits is 100 nits, wether your screen's maximum brightness is 600 or 1000. Highlights will be darker, but everything else should be fine. What you're losing in such case is the ability to crank up the overall brightness higher (which rises the requirements to show highlights properly). It doesn't mean the picture is wrong - as I've said, SDR is supposed to be 100 nits, and HDR content for tv on average is around that value as well. Everything else is just multiplying the reference, and because of the nature of HDR, you need a much brighter screen if that's what you want.

My personal take is that such wide dynamic range (content targeting 100 nits on average with even 1000 nits highlights) is an overkill and they should target 200 nits on average at least. It is what it is though. Also, you shouldn't compare tv content to ""HDR demos"" from youtube - which target much higher brightness on average - or to the output from games, which often have HDR setting to choose your screen's maximum brightness so the game can adjust to it on the fly, while targeting higher than 100 nits brightness on average as well.

Hopefully this clears things up a bit. HDR is great, just perhaps a bit underutilized so far.",0,6864,1108
"I don't get Blood of ZeusWhy is this show so highly rated by critics?

2. The characters and narrative feel 100% literal with no layers and nuance as if the story was written in the 1950s and never adapted for a modern audience.
3. The style of animation and the awkwardness/stiffness of character interactions evokes the 80s.

"You really should watch The Queen's GambitI just finished the series in less than 2 days and I loved every minute of it and I think you'd love it too.

Honestly it's one of the best netflix originals ever and clearly the best of the year. There are several reasons for that. Its subject can be pretty surprising and off-putting to some (not me though, always loved chess so I was intrigued from the start!) but it's handled with such talent and efficiency that even if you don't even know the rules, you won't get bored. The chess matches are so well done and are genuinely exciting but that's also because there is so much more to it. It's a story about resilience and trusting yourself and become the master of your own fate, which, granted, sounds a bit cheesy but honestly.. it's just very inspiring. They also touch on so many other subjects with class, subtlety and restraint and it's just delightful and drives the point home.

Everything about her story is interesting and captivating and the excellent Anya Taylor-Joy (who I have loved ever since The VVitch) just makes the story shine. Her performance is stellar, with a heavy focus on attitude, facial expressions and body language which makes her acting so incredibly good and honestly ? Worthy of all the awards she could get. She's insanely talented the story really lets her flex her acting muscles and gives a nuanced and electric performance. 

The solitude she faced is perfectly conveyed through the directing, the music and her acting that it can almost be overwhelming. It can be pretty sad but they never overdo it.  It's genuinely beautiful and enthralling to see her progress through her career and form new connections and to see her relationships evolve. Nothing ever feels gratuitous, **the writing is superb. It's incredibly subtle and understated but it's so perfectly written that it just amplifies every emotion they want to convey.** The dialogues and the acting are **great** too. So is the directing, the photography, and the sets and costumes which are absolutely gorgeous. And the music.... the music is incredible, poignant at times, exciting and thrilling when it needs to be. **It is superb work they've done here**.

Honestly I could just go on and on about it, it's just a really great show. It's real and genuine and the ending might be the best ending to a miniseries I've ever seen ? It's beautiful and satisfying and **it just made me feel so good**, which I think we all need right now.",0,2482,430

It centers on the biggest crime case in Argentina's history involving the death of an upper class woman. As with most Netflix docs, it continues the infuriating practice of pushing the information to the absolute limit (4 hours when it could have easily been told in 2 hours). I was looking at giving up on it and just reading what happened until they drop an absolute bomb at the end of first episode. By the end you will have all kinds of thoughts on the justice system, media sensationalism, and witch hunts. One warning: It has subtitles and tons of family members you have to keep track of.

Now what the fuck now? I thought it was really pushing it when it was $12 something but this is obscene. I literally only got it to binge watch cobra kai. The vast majority of netflix library, like 95% of original content is unwatchable trash that makes me miss the good old days of cable(ok I'm exaggerating here). But I'm really at a loss for words here. At least with amazon prime video I feel like I'm getting something for my money.

"Netflix, Breaking Bad, and my Mexican GrandmotherI just thought I‚Äôd tell a story some of you may enjoy from two years ago that happens to involve my Mexican Grandmother, and the tv show ‚ÄúBreaking Bad‚Äù.

My Grandmother, who we call ‚ÄúMami Lupe‚Äù, lives in Mexico. But every other year she comes and spends a few weeks to a month here at our house here in Texas for and extended stay. 

This specific time was in August 2018, where she stayed for a month.

And during one of the weeks she was here, with my Mom having to leave for work from 8-5 during the week. During that time I was home more often than not since of my college classes were online during that time. So in essence I was here keeping her company so she wouldn‚Äôt get bored.

I‚Äôd try and find stuff we could watch together on Netflix so that she wouldn‚Äôt either take a nap or sit reading the Spanish tabloid she‚Äôd brought with her on her trip . As is with Netflix most of the time, it‚Äôs always toss up with what subtitles and dubs are available for its library content. 

So I thought ‚ÄúWhy not show her Breaking Bad?‚Äù. Now years ago, I‚Äôd binged a majority of the show on Netflix. Which I was then able to see Season 5B as it aired live back in 2013.

I searched ‚ÄúBreaking Bad‚Äù and clicked on it to start playing on Episode 1. And As soon as the first episode‚Äôs opening scene showed with the fade-in of the desert cactus. I went to top and saw what was available as far as subtitles and language dubs.

I figured only Spanish subtitles would be available. But to my surprise a Spanish dub was also there, which I happily clicked. 

More so because my Grandmother at that time was 85. And I knew there was no way the show would keep her attention long enough if she had to read subtitles for an extended period of time.

And sure enough she was semi-into it the first couple episodes. Then once Tuco showed up that‚Äôs when she went from casual viewer to fully onboard. Once my mom arrived from work that day even she noticed how into the show my Grandmother was.

That night we had to stop watching it around early into the second season. The following morning, my Grandmother eventually asked me if I could put it on for her as she was really getting into it. And I being a Breaking Bad fan, I happily obliged.

And over the next few days we eventually binged the whole series. Which for me was funny in that this was going to be my second time watching the show from beginning to end. And I was watching it in Spanish (which I understand) but siting there with her made it that much more enjoyable.

My mom eventually chided both my Grandmother and I for not doing much else here while at home. But my Grandmother wanted to keep the binge going. And I of course was not going to stop her.

There‚Äôs multiple moments that stand out as far as her reaction. But for length I‚Äôll name one of my favorites. 

From the ‚ÄúFly‚Äù episode, after realizing that the it would revolve around a fly she eventually came to say ‚Äúpues esa mugre mosca, como no la pueden Matar‚Äù. (‚ÄúThat damn fly, why don‚Äôt they just kill it‚Äù)

She enjoyed most of the characters on the show. ‚ÄúGus‚Äù, ‚ÄúWalt‚Äù, and ‚ÄúMike‚Äù. 

But the one that stood out to her most was ‚ÄúJessie‚Äù. And his character arc was one that once it arrived at the end she was about as invested as anything that came before it.

Of course once we finished it. I thought well hell, why not get her into ‚ÄúBetter Call Saul‚Äù. But It didn‚Äôt take long to realize she just wasn‚Äôt going to be into it as much as she was with ‚ÄúBreaking Bad‚Äù.

Which having seen ‚ÄúBetter Call Saul‚Äù since it first started airing, I love it just as much as ‚ÄúBreaking Bad‚Äù. But I eventually realized the fact that it was a prequel, my Grandmother just wasn‚Äôt going to be into it.

Earlier this year pre-covid shutdown she visited us again for an extended period of time. And I figured maybe she‚Äôd enjoy continuing watching Jessie‚Äôs story in ‚ÄúEl Camino‚Äù. 

But unfortunately so much time had passed that she really didn‚Äôt have much recollection of Jessie character arc that from Breaking Bad.

Last week, as she was visiting the house of one of my uncles (her son) she suffered a heart attack/stroke. And since then she‚Äôs been interned at nearby hospital.

And Earlier Today, things took a turn for the worse and she suffered two more mini heart attacks and our family has been told it‚Äôs just a matter of hours she has left until she passes.

I just decided to write this as a way of focusing the grief I‚Äôm feeling into a tribute to my Grandmother (as tiny as it may be). Which I find myself laughing and crying while writing this because watching the entire ‚ÄúBreaking Bad‚Äù series in Spanish with my Grandmother over the course of a few days is something I‚Äôll never forget. 

But I find comfort in having shared those special few days with her where we got to watch would I (and what I think a majority of us would consider to be) one of the greatest Television shows ever made.

So for that I not only want to Thank the Creators and everyone involved with the ‚ÄúBreaking Bad‚Äù Universe. But to Netflix also, for having subtitles and dubs for other Languages that allowed for us the opportunity to bond watching it.",0,5170,964

Netflix doesn't care about you watching the credits, as they auto-play episodes 7 or so seconds after the show ends. However we have to stop every 20 to 50 minutes to skip the intro. Its just a quality of life enchancement for Netflix users that I came up with watching stuff.

"The Haunting of Bly Manor is really REALLYYY boring.Ok so couple days back I started watching this series, I was told that the story line is really good. And I love a well written show/movie.

It had me hooked till 4th episode I think but man after that I completely lost interest. Why you ask?

Firstly, the story line goes for a toss and you are forced to wrap your head around the jumping timelines and the characters repeatedly saying, "" I have been tucked away in a memory again "".

Secondly, there are a lot of loop holes and so many questionable situations. The characters are not reacting to some awfully weird things. They are simply playing along to this madness.

All in all, the actors walks too slow, they talk too show, the camera moment is also really slow. I mean, it came to a point that everything became too predictable and a bit annoying and not scary at all. What annoyed me the most was the never ending repeated scenes, Dani breathing heavily, kids running where ever they feel like, and their Uncle's alter ego? I mean. Did not sign up for this.

PS: It possibly could be just my opinion but I really truly felt that way about it. No offense to it's fans or to the people who actually like it.

"Netflix Account TakeoverSomething really strange just happened to me. Someone has taken over control of my Netflix account, changed the email, and changed the billing credit card twice (apparently last week). This means I can't take back control of that account because it is no longer tied to my email, and I can't verify identity via current mode of billing or previous mode of billing because they changed cc twice??? 

&amp;#x200B;

I find it really strange because it seems like a very inconvenient way to access Netflix. won't it just be easier to open their own account? (Plus they lose out on the free 30 days). Other than the past 20mins with the live chat, and the 30 secs it would probably take me to create a new account, it does not seem  to inconvenience me much either.

"Dark is really utterly boring.So I am watching the first episode, so far , i am so freaking bored to death.  

From the beginning , the problem that I see is that the series starts showing all their cards way too early, talking about time travel, past, present future, and so on. There is no showing progressive build up. Also way too many dialogues, monologues, and abuse in words to explain everything instead of showing visuals. It feels like watching a japanese drama ampt up to a 1000. Also some of the acting i find it quite bad. Another thing is the change in from one character to another from one time to another makes it not only annoying but quite hard to understand what is happening. It feels as they trow many elements just for the sake of trying to make it complex.

"Short Review (no spoilers) of ""The Haunting of Hill House""I'm an avid fan of horror shows, and unfortunately I'm catching up thanks to both COVID haze (time dilation, not actual COVID) so I just marathoned ""The Haunting of Hill House"" for the last two days.

First off, there is no correlation between ""The Haunting of Hill House"" and ""The Legend of Hell House"" (the 1973 paranormal horror movie).  It took a couple of episodes of the movie's 10-episode sprint to make that clear however it is my opinion that ""The Haunting of Hill House"" is a movie series that should be held in the same echelon of ""The Legend of Hell House"".

The movie's story arc is spread across 10 60 minute (on average) episodes and paints the interconnected story of the five children (Steven, Shirley, Theo, Luke, Nell) and their father Hugh in their more adult years after a particular night at Hill House that finally drove them away.  It shows in great detail the descent into madness of Olivia (Hugh's wife and the children's mother) and Hugh's steadfastness or more rather his disassociation to events that occurred at Hill House.  Time is spent showing each of the children's experiences with the house, both good and bad. 

The story itself is one of incredible sadness and of death (well, of course there's death, it's a paranormal movie after all...), but moreso how each member's experiences were interconnected with each other, and how overall in order to survive, it was necessary to face each person's pockmarked past and right old wrongs.  Far from being a sterotypical ""finished business"" ghost story, this was deeper and more intense.  Throughout the episodes, you can see how each member's experience was crafted by the interactions at Hill House, even after the father and the children were able to escape.  

Each episode is well compartmentalized, with just enough cliffhanger to send you running to the ""Next Episode"" button.  It is not an action movie, but each episode keeps the storyline advancing with a good pace.  It's more of a slow burn psychological horror than a horror story that relies on gore and jump scares.  There's lot of things in the background that you may not notice the first time, but when the movie calls you out on it, you'll want to scroll back and see what you missed.  There's a lot of subtle things in the details that you'll want to watch out for.  

If I had a rational scale for rating this movie series any more specific over ""I liked it"", ""I hated it"", ""I changed the show"", I'd say I give this an 8 out of 10 on the horror flick.  Comparatively, the ""Legend of Hell House"" was a 9/10 on the same relative scale.  It's hard to write a review without spoilers, especially for a horror flick, as there's lots of things I could discuss but that would result in spoilers, if not for the episode then for the overall story arc. 

Good:  
\- Slow burn psychological horror with a good long term story line.  
\- Story doesn't rely on bland tricks.  Jumpscares (rare) are well executed.  
\- The concurrency of the stories plays off well and allows you to see several incidents from each person's view.  
\- The story doesn't expressly rely on trope, but instead allows the environment to set the scene, Excellent use of audio cues and visual markers to instill various emotions in scenes.

Bad:  
\- Acting is flat sometimes, but they nail it on the important parts.  
\- The plot can be hard to track sometimes, especially in the first three or four episodes.  
\- If you're expecting an action packed ending of triumph, you won't get it but the story does bring closure to the various timelines.

Ugly:  
\- Be prepared to skip through a few scenes in the second show if you are a cat lover.  Don't worry, only a tiny bit of gore at the end, but largely just sadness.",0,3794,666

"Help with downloads on NetflixHi everyone,

My partner's Dad is in hospital and we decided to put Netflix on an old Samsung tablet for him. As the hospital has no WiFi and the tablet has no data connection we thought we could just download content onto the SD card in the tablet (by changing the download destination settings in the app). This all went well until I tried to open the app with no data connection. It just says ""Sorry, we could not reach the Netflix service. Please try again later. (-4)""

The only option is 'OK' which closes the app. It doesn't give the option to access the content that has already been downloaded.

I tried contacting Netflix but they haven't been able to resolve the issue. I tried signing out then in, and clearing the cache and data but I still have the same error.

It might be because it's an older tablet but why have the download function if it doesn't work when the device isn't connected to the Internet?

Can anyone help? We are hoping to drop the tablet by hospital before lock down begins on Thursday! (in the UK here)

Thank you!",0,1078,197

"Nobody‚Äôs talking about Grand Army?It came out like 3 weeks ago and yet I didn‚Äôt know it existed until 2 days ago- in which I then proceeded to binge watch it.- Netflix usually shoves new shows in my face with emails, notifications, and constant previews on the home page but this got nothing...? 

Anyways, it‚Äôs just another high school drama but..
*The cast is actually diverse in a way that ISN‚ÄôT completely forced in order to please audiences.
*It doesn‚Äôt rely on aesthetics to prop up the show- but still has one (mostly due to the camera work imo)
*The plots and characters are compelling enough imo.
*The acting‚Äôs good (imo), despite most of the actors not having worked on a lot of projects before.
*It‚Äôs actually realistic (but only up to a certain point  ofc, things will always become exaggerated in tv to entertain audiences). I don‚Äôt know the extent to how true this statement is for others because everyone has different high school experiences.

(There are probably more things but I can‚Äôt think of them atm)

I‚Äôm 99% sure that it will get cancelled after the first season due to its low reception and controversy revolving around the producers, which is annoying ofc -but there are so many other shows to watch so I‚Äôll get over it. Idk how many people this post will reach but I‚Äôm just curious about how many people on this sub have even heard about it.

Also, if you do decide to watch, proceed with caution pls.",0,1428,254

"The Queen's Gambit. Spoilery theory!!!I just finished watching the Queen's Gambit and absolutely loved it. But there is a detail that never quite sat right with me and I wonder if anyone else has written about or explored this idea.

The car accident that Beth survives doesn't make any sense. She was in the back seat of the car. in the 1950s. She is wearing no discernable seat belt... Maybe she had a two-point seat belt, as if that would do anything to protect her. She was in a head-on collision with another vehicle travelling in the opposite direction that immediately killed the mother. In the only image of the accident that the series shows, Beth is seen in the foreground in front of the wrecked vehicles WITHOUT A SINGLE SCRATCH ON HER. From that moment on it is taken for granted that this accident is the true cause of her mother's death and the reason for her being orphaned.

This show isn't about superheroes with magical powers. It is about a chess prodigy leaving in a plausible alternative universe where instead of Bobby Fischer taking on the Soviets in chess it is a young redheaded orphan girl. The psychological tone of the story is so well realized that I can't help but think that the unbelievability of Beth surviving the car accident ISN'T lazy writing. I think that the story of her mother's death is one that Beth made up to quell her own feelings of abandonment. It is another layer to the story that speaks to the reality (or lack thereof) of the events depicted in the series. After all, the POV for the series is Beth Harmon's. I don't think this means that every event in the show as a whole is necessarily unreliable as it is in The Joker starring Joaquin Phoenix. But I do think that it is meaningful that the accident itself is never depicted on the show. We the audience never see the two cars collide with one another. And in storytelling, if you don't see something, then you can't know exactly what happened.

Maybe her mother did die in the accident. Maybe Beth tells herself, and even believes, that she was in the car. But there is NO WAY that Beth actually survived the car accident as it is described on the show.

But my question is this- what was the significance of the cake scene(panna cotta) around the 36 minute mark? I believe gorenge was on floor 171 at this time, then 33 then 202 then 6, when they planned on salvaging the cake, atleast 3 months later. Why show this scene arbitrarily? Is this not a flash back but a flash forward? But didnt the kid eat the cake? Is the kid real? Was everything after gorenge got hurt a hallucination? I dont think its outside the real of possibility since baharat/ the old guy was hallucinated by gorenge. 

 I'm so freaking confused and I know you guys dont have the end all be all answer, but I'd like to hear your thoughts on this.",0,858,152

""Cracker"" is definitely considered a racial slur, particularly during the era it is representing,  and I do not understand how Netflix let that go and NO ONE has said a word about it.

"Help: What Is This Comedy Series Called??There was a great comedy series I loved on Netflix a few years back.

It was a group of 5 people who fought evil people, like a Scooby Doo type vibe. Also had the Archer sense in that it was real and pseudo sophisticated.

They wore blue uniforms, their boss had an eagle‚Äôs head for a head (I kid you not) and one of the characters always quoted a cocktail recipe before he died.

"Replaying a Previous Episode Instead of Next Episode [US]Has anyone else had it happen where you click to play the next episode in a series you are watching from the ""Continue Watching"" line, only for it to play an episode you already finished? This has happened to me primarily on my Android 10 app. When I go to view the episode list for some reason some episodes will have the red completion bar toward the end of the episode where I either stopped play or hit the ""Next Episode"" popup, but some episodes have no bar at all, as if they were never watched. And it seems Netflix just defaults to playing whichever is the first sequential episode that has not been watched, even if it is one of those episodes that *has* been watched, but lost the red progress bar.

Am I doing something wrong on my end or is this a Netflix error? I never let the credits finish on any movie or show I watch so I don't think it's an issue of the red progress bar reaching the end of the episode and resetting.

Don't be put off by the description on Netflix, it really doesnt do it justice and just makes it sound like a typical haunted house flick. 

Don't get me wrong, it's a horror movie at its core, plenty of jumps and haunting imagery that left an impression on me, an impression I'm sure will come back when i turn the lights out, but there is also real life horrors and an emotional and hard hitting plot line that unfolds beneath the story of the haunted house. 

Excellent performances, fantastic special effects, good sounds and music, overall tone and pacing is great too. 

I cannot recommend this film enough.

The mother is killed by an evil force and the young man goes on a revenge path.

Normally I would pass it off as coincidence, but the fact that the stories have so many similarities is a little suspect. Epirus bow = blue sword, the gods fight over when to save the mortals (which to be fair is in every Greek epic), the fact that after the main characters mom is killed he is taken captive. 

I‚Äôd like to hear other‚Äôs opinions on this. Is this just a super common trope in Greek mythology, or is there some fairly obvious inspiration taken?",0,989,183

"netflix users: How does Netflix tell you about their price increases?I don't pay for netflix, but if I did, I'd be interested in a price increase, since, you know, money. 

How does Netflix tell you that your prices are going up? In an email? And if so, what the hell does that email say? Not trying to be super negative here, and I don't really have a horse in this race anyways, but a basic glance suggests a reduction in quality with an *increase* in price.

"Haunting of Bly Manor metaphor [SPOILERS]Spoilers ahead so beware. 

After watching the entire show in one sitting, the ending was pretty brutal on my emotions as was expected. As a gay man, watching two women fall in love with each other made me feel so happy, but watching Dani wrestle for her body and mind was tragic.

The timeframe of when they were together coincides with the timeframe of the LGBT community‚Äôs darkest years when people were dying at the highest rate from HIV/AIDS.

Being diagnosed with HIV was a death sentence. It has a mortality rate of 100% if left untreated, and at the time the US government was denying the existence of any virus whatsoever so treatments were nonexistent. It was easy for them to deny. The only people it was killing were gay people and no one cared for them. Those infected knew that the virus would eventually take them as it has taken so many before. It was impossible to be gay and not have friends or loved ones who have died from it. 

The virus would eat you alive from the inside out until you‚Äôre left with mostly nothing. It was such a brutal death that even doctors and nurses were afraid to treat anyone with it. To me, Dani‚Äôs possession is a powerful metaphor for this. That despite so many people being handed this death sentence, they still tried to live the rest of their lives as fully as they could. They fell in love, they fought, but eventually they couldn‚Äôt fight anymore. The brutal reality that sometimes love just isn‚Äôt enough to save the one you love. Eventually that unseeable death would come for them.

Maybe I‚Äôm reading too into it, but it was the harsh reality for LGBT people at the time. It‚Äôs a part of history that goes relatively ignored outside of our circles, but it‚Äôs a tragic one nonetheless and there‚Äôs much to learn from it.",0,1811,326

"Why is Netflix increasing their prices while their (worthwhile) lineup seems like its shrinking?They're removing things like The Office, Parks and Rec, etc. They cancel whatever original shows they have after a season or two which make it difficult to even attempt to get invested in those shows. While doing this they're increasing their price up while they have competitors; massive ones like Disney having their prices as low as 8 dollars for basically everything Disney owns which is all movie studios.

"Mira Nair's ""A Suitable Boy"" sucks monumentally. Let's admit it.If there's a personification of the word ""Awkward"", this show is it. 

Right from the beginning, every character, every scene, every dialogue is awkward. It seems as if the actors knew what they are doing is massively wrong.

The show starts in 1951, India has attained independence recently and for some strange reason, every damn body right from the young to the old, speak in an antiquated English that can only be spoken after an elaborate consultation with a thick thesaurus and 1800's dictionary.

C'mon , this is India. Not, England on Enema.

Then there are the actors who seem like they were forced out of bed and punished to act. There's a scene in the series with Tabu, one of the best actresses of India starts laughing when her consort arrives and  interrogates about whether there's another man in her life. The way she laughs is so ridiculously fake, my eyes started rolling automatically. It is supposed to be pivotal point but ends up being a total puke point. Absolute worst scene in the series.

Whereas there are so many characters in the story, and it each one has their own intricate narrative, it is totally lost here. The only saving grace is Meenakshi, the playful, care-free daughter in law who's having a secret affair and doesn't give a damn about what anyone thinks. I think I watched only for her, she was delightful. 

You can watch it if you want to learn how not to make an utterly crappy series out of a classic. But meh, rather sleep.",0,1533,269

Comment below describes my thoughts.

The story has a family-oriented twist, magic is involved (and learned Star Wars-esque bildungsroman-style by the protagonist), a death in the family, and flying (kinda spaceship-like).

"I'm confused about a few details of im thinking of ending things, can someone help me understand them?Around 10 minutes in the camera zooms in on Jakes lips and they look odd (can't remember exactly what was wrong with them). I read that it showed Lucy being more focused on the saliva at the corner of his lips than whatever he was saying. I guess the janitor was imagining her not being interested in what he had to say.

Around 15 minutes in, while Lucy recites the poem, we get a shot outside of the car and we can't hear Lucy for a few seconds, then we go back in the car to hear the rest of the poem. 

Towards the end of their visit, Jakes father hugs Lucy and she starts crying. Was jake abused by his parents? He clearly holds resentment towards them, during the meeting scene he just shook his hand and didn't want his mother to touch him. 

During the last scene with Lucy and Jake in the car Lucy randomly has a black eye for a single shot which dissappears in the next one. Was he imaging a scenario in which he was abusive towards her because of all the self hatred, even in his fantasy he had to be a bad person? The briefness of it was odd though.

At tulsa town there girl claims its smell because they're burning something, then later says it's because of something else. What actually is it?

They kept repeating the word Treacherous. Same with the chains but that seemed like a metaphor for her being trapped or chained down, not sure what significance the word Treacherous has though. No one is betrayed or being deceptive really, except for the movie I guess.

"New Animation Show on NetflixHey all!

I just thought I would bring to everyone's attention to a new Netflix original anime- style television show that has caught my eye. It is called ""Blood Of Zeus"" and it is beautifully animated and incredibly written. 

The plot goes as follows: ""Chronicles the illegitimate son of Zeus, a young man tasked with saving heaven and earth despite the interference of a vengeful goddess and her monstrous forces.""

The show used to go by the name of ""Gods&amp;Heroes"". If you like Greek Mythology, then this show was made for you. It has all the main key players of Greek Mythology in their respective elements. A lot of power and mysticism, mythical creatures and war.

Be wary tho it does contain some violence for those who are squeamish when it comes to that, because this anime has a lot of gruesome killings in it, so it is not for the faint of heart, but the plot is really good and the story sucks you in, so if you can get passed the dark parts, then you are in for a treat.
It's in the fantasy, action and adventure Genre.

This anime is only in season 1 of this original series for Netflix and it already has me on the edges of all of my seats. As far as Greek Mythology animes go this is the best one I've seen yet. I really hope that they make more than 1 season because I believe it is truly worth more than just 1.
Man against man. God against god. Demons. Oracles. It's worth every minute.

"Anyone here still renting DVDs?Yes, renting Netflix DVDs is still a thing. About 2 million people in the United States still do it. And with good reason.

Netflix has a HUGE selection of films on its streaming service. But sometimes more is not better. Sometimes it's just more.

I like getting DVDs because I am tired of combing through Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, etc. to find a movie I'm interested in... only to find it's unavailable or costs money to rent.

A lot of stuff on Netflix streaming is great. But I don't want to be able to only watch what everyone else is watching. Oftentimes, the films that are the most popular are also the safest and least-stimulating. 

I know delivery times have gotten slower lately, but I still think it's worth it. 

What do you guys think? Do you find you have a richer viewing experience renting DVDs and Blu-Rays from Netflix, insteading of just watching streaming content?",0,920,160

* the protagonist had to live in a remote location since birth because of his father
* Chiron betrays an old friend for the sake of his people, the protagonist's enemies had just arrived there before they did
* Seraphim tells Heron that he's either with him, or against him, in a red/hellish looking location

"Netflix My List not working - Titles don't get added to the start / top - Manual Ordering culprit PSATL:DR If you are having this issue, the only real fix at the moment is to go to  [https://www.netflix.com/MyListOrder](https://www.netflix.com/MyListOrder) and switch it from Manual Ordering to Netflix Suggests and back again, or just leave it on Netflix Suggests.  Switching it back and forth will temporarily fix the ""Titles not getting added to the start"" issue, but it will eventually revert.  If I had to guess, because this is an optional function that most people don't know about or how to even find, Netflix may never fix it.  If you decide to stick with Netflix Suggests and you want to update a title to the beginning of your My List, simply remove the title and add it again.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

So those not in the know, Netflix has an option of switching the standard My List to a manual ordering list.  This option was more common place awhile back, but has seemingly gone to the way side.  The Manual Ordering was pretty great once upon a time, where you could have a literal list of your titles and manually move them around as you see fit.  See here: [https://i.imgur.com/tZjiHSW.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/tZjiHSW.jpg) 

In the above image you can see it is an actual list layout and not a block preview format.  When you highlight a title, by design it's supposed to allow you to drag titles up and down the list to change their order.  You are also supposed to be able to click ""Move to top"" and it will do just that: move a title to the top of your list.

Unfortunately, Netflix's My List in manual order has not been working properly for many for some time now.  For me, except ***maybe*** randomly fixing itself very temporarily at times before going back to being broken, it has been this way for at least a couple years.  In fact, I had forgotten I had switched to manual ordering years ago, so I didn't realize it was this specific thing that was broken.  I then noticed that on my account's other profiles, that they didn't have the issue and that their ""My List"" was at least populating new titles correctly.

After calling Netflix support, they told me that the manual order of lists was not working and currently being worked on, but no time frame as to when it will be fixed.  She had no explanation as to why it had been broken for so long.  I ***wish*** she had told me that it was something involving the Manual Ordering setting specifically, and how to switch it off, which I had honestly forgotten about.  

It was at that point that I had a lightbulb turn on and went and found the setting, tried turning it off and on, and realized that was the culprit.  The My List went back to normal so at least I can keep track of my most recent title additions.  I had honestly stopped using Netflix very much because of this, since any recent titles I had added I would constantly forget about because they weren't easy to see.

So what's broken about it?  

* If you attempt to add a new title to your list, instead if it being added to the top / start where you can see it, it either adds the title to the bottom / end, or randomly down in the middle of your list.  For me it adds the titles 40-50 spots down on my list.  I've read that others it's in the 20-30 range.  This can be remedied by turning off Manual Ordering and turning it back on, or simply keeping it off altogether.
* Attempt to use the manual ordering function by moving titles around will cause the page to refresh and they will wind up right back where they were, or even worse, the titles will end up moving down to the BOTTOM / END of your list where you sometimes can't find them.  The only way to fix that is removing the title and readding it.
* Clicking ""Move to top"" will simply always end up adding the title to the bottom of your list instead of the top.

One constant between both formats is that if you have too many titles on your My List, you can't see them all.  It appears Netflix has a limit as to how many titles you can see.  The only way you can see beyond the bottom of your list is if you delete some titles from the ones visible, and then you'll be able to see additional titles hidden in your My List.

Well, I hope they fix the Manual Ordering one day, because it was a great feature.  Not holding my breath, though.  Just figured I'd post this since not even Netflix support was able to help me with my issue by applying this simple fix.",0,4585,823

"If you can't stream above 720p on your laptop on the windows app, here's how I fixed it. (Only if you have a dedicated GPU)I don't know if this is a widespread fix or even a widespread problem but I had it so I thought I'd share it.

I always watched Netflix on my tab cause I always thought it looked bad on my laptop. Today I got around to finally figuring out why. Turns out I've been watching it in 720p. Saw an article online that told me to check using the Ctrl+Alt+Shift+D method.

I knew all my settings were set to high so I didn't know why this was happening. I thought maybe Netflix wasn't using my nvidia gpu and was using the integrated one. I tried to change the preference from the nvidia control panel but it didn't work.

"Netflix not working on Samsung smart TV.So around 5 days ago Netflix started to behave buggy, such as crashing, freezing, spasming, etc on my Samsung smart TV.

I initially thought it was a fault with my TV so I factory reset the whole TV and now Netflix won't install, I get an error code 118026.

To check if it was my TV I installed some other apps and they installed and opened just fine. Just Netflix won't install. Everytime I try to install Netflix I get the same error code 118026.

"Netflix app causes my phone to rebootHello!

For a few months I¬¥ve been having this problem with the app in which when I try to stream anything on my phone, it causes it to reboot. Streaming on my chromecast works fine (as long as the chromecast works, but that¬¥s another device¬¥s problem)

I suspect it might have something to do with the fact I¬¥m using a custom ROM, but I have actually no clue. Netflix¬¥s help service has been useless, basically telling me ¬®Tough luck¬® and not giving anymore answers.

they do love their humour as well so maybe funny movies would also be good.

I don't know much about my grandma and how she likes her TV because she doesn't watch much but i do know that my grandpa does love his neo-noir, mystery, detective/ crime films so yeah.

"Just finished ""Queens Gambit"" Spoiler free reviewI would like to start off by saying, even if you don't like or understand the game of chess the story is still worth watching. That's not to say there isn't something for the Chess community as well. They find a great balance. 

I'll start off with what I like about the show:

1. The casting is really solid. Anya Taylor who plays ""Beth"" in the tv show plays this character really well. It's one of those situations where I couldn't see anyone else playing the character. Thomas brodie is also in series as well which threw me off at first. When he first appeared in the show I kept questioning if that was him or not since his character (Benny) wears this ridiculous outfit. But he was also another strong character which you grow to love. There are others I could mention but I don't want to write about the entire cast 

2. Story 
The story is really a rags to riches/ coming of age story. From the start Beth is put into unfortunate circumstances. She's also is different than other kids and doesn't really fit in with people her age.  Overall her story arc is well done. I don't want to say to much or I'll give it away 

3. Messages/undertones
The story really plays into addiction. It's a repeating theme throughout the whole series. It's the good the bad and the ugly of addiction. The way they portray addiction is pretty much how I see it in real life. It become more of a need then a want. So I thought they portrayed it really well. 

Things I didn't like: 
1. It's hard to think of something I don't like about the show because I almost find it flawless. Meaning I could past somethings since the overall series was great. I think it lacks clarity on some issues. With out going into detail one character dies but we never truly figured out how? Which bothers for some reason even though it wasn't important to the story as much 

Overall I'll give it 9.7/10 definitely recommend watching it 

Side note: I was thinking about making a video where I go more in depth about the Series with spoilers. Let me know if you'd watch something like that or even if you guys want something like that.",0,2153,394

"LGBTQ Relationships in Children's ShowsHello everyone, I wanted to respectfully bring to attention an issue that I think has been all too prevalent in the past years. In animated children's shows, it is very hard to publicly show gay relationships due to the studios not approving it or international backlash. The importance here is that we introduce kids to these kinds of relationships early on. Proper representation of LGBTQ relationships in these shows help children to understand that these are very real and normal things. It also helps LGBTQ youth validate their feelings when they start expiring same-sex or other LGBTQ attraction. But when you age restrict something like She-RA on Netflix simply because it display homosexuality, it reenforces the idea that there is something inappropriate about LGBTQ romances. It is important for parents of youth to be aware of these injustices. I would like to know your thoughts in the comments and how you feel about this. Thank you!

"In light of the recent Netflix cancellations, should Netflix obey what customers want to be considered a valuable streaming service?I ask this because Netflix has let a lot of customers disappointed this year with the huge streak of cancellations they've been doing, either because some of their shows don't make a lot of money or don't get a big audience, or due to the Coronavirus, providing uncertainty to production companies that want to return to their labors as usual. Also, for some customers, it feels like Netflix is cancelling more shows than the average Cable TV network, even though it's way less than that.  But what bothers me about the people on reddit, or online forums, is that they think Netflix owes us a lot for canceling their shows, and they have to please us if they want to succeed. We've seen dozens of written articles and videos that have informed us why Netflix cancels their originals when they're not the expected successes, and yet there's a lot of people on the internet who won't shut up about the service is betraying customer's trust by cancelling shows they like, and how they have to finish their shows if they want to earn customers back again. But we need to get some things clear for these discussions:

* Netflix is not a charity company. TV Networks are not a charity company either. They're in all their rights to cancel any series if it's not pulling in their desired amount of audience they need to justify the costs of their shows. If it's a show with great critical reception, and it's also an unconventional show that breaks molds and delivers better content than expected, but it's audience is a very niche group of people that you can count with one hand, it means the show doesn't work for the production company, and they have to cancel it. AS much as Netlfix users coment online about how much they loved The OA and Santa Clarita Diet, if there was little audience watching these shows when they started, and less than that in subsequent seasons, they deserve to be cancelled, much to your dismay. It's the same as if you open a grocery store but the only people buying products in there are 20 every day instead of 200 customers that you expect to see per day. 
* Not all the shows share the same demographics,and this is an important factor for TV production companies. Some shows are exclusively liked by sci-fi nerds, other s by prestige TV fans, others by period pieces lovers, etc. Some shows are able to reach more than one group of audience, and these are the ones the big TV production companies value the most, which is why you see Netflix creating so many shows in the hope they get a big hit, like with Stranger Things and The Witcher, shows capable of pulling in more than one exclusive demographic. We also have  to take into account that depending on the specific demographic, these groups have a set number of fans, but the big companies need a bigger number of people from that demographic to sustain the shows. For example, as much as sci-fi nerds loved The OA, Netflix expected a bigger audience than just 5000 sci-fi nerds from the whole world who watched the first season to justify the expenses on that show.
* The people on reddit or internet forums are pissed off about Netflix targeting critically well received shows for their cancellations, while internet people ask ""why don't they cancel their garbage shows like Another Life, or The Ranch, or Paradise PD? They should know nobody watches that garbage"", but the internet people don't know which audience actually watches these shows enough to keep them alive, and given than these shows pull off more than one target demographic around the world, they're successful by the company's metrics, so they will only be cancelled when necessary. The fact that the garbage shows are kept alive doesn't mean that the company is doing a disservice to its customers, because what you like is not what the average, mainstream audience doesn't like. And this is another thing we have to take into account: The mainstream audience doesn't like complicated shows that take a lot of effort and attention span to understand. They don't like prestige shows that send them to sleep. They like shows that entertain them, regardless of quality. Would you like your grandpa to just watch cool HBO shows just because they're prestige and great TV, even though your grandpa hates these shows?

My question is why online users don't shut up about these posts that overwhelm Reddit and other online forums, despite the plethora of clarifications and information provided? The discussions about users hating Netflix cancellations should dissapear by now, or maybe the online forum people should do a strike against Netflix cancellations in whichever way they want. With a strike maybe the company reconsiders the idea of reviving some shows, and even then the company will not do what you want because they will still care about what's profitable.",0,4953,854

"Emily in paris and how a belgium pov can give you a better insight in cultural differences. 

Usa  culture is not only very big, it's also very influential,  so a usa  show that points out the differences with a european culture (that is  not english), is interesting to say the least.

Now  , why is a belgium pov going to teach you more about the cultural  differences. Well  belgium is a small country between the netherlands  and france and consists of two major parts, a dutch speaking part, and a  french speaking part.

Now dutch  speaking people from the netherlands, as you may already know, are very  good in english, and by that have  a lot of affinity with usa culture.  However, dutch speaking belgians  speak a bit of french as well, and  also have affinity with french culture.

So dutch speaking belgians, can see the differences in french/usa culture from both ways.

About  the show,  I'm glad the show wasn't scared to adress the differences  when it comes to sex and sexuality (or is it sexism lol), and still keep  it light.

Still I  understand why  the french are a bit upset, the  french aren't womenizers and they  aren't mean either,  it might look that way because the way they are  culturally , but they are very friendly people, let me  explain.

When I go to the north  (towards the netherlands) we go down straight to business. If I go south  (towards france) everything is different. and this cultural change goes  quite quickly, I'm talking about a range of 40-60 miles.

In  france it's still important how  good my work is, but what is also very important is how I deal with them. The french have a word for it , la  gentillesse, which means kindness, gentleness, or friendliness.

See  I can go fuck up a job in france and the french won't even care as long  as I am gentille (friendly). When you are a technician that needs to  fix something in france, they'l give you food and drinks.They'll kiss  you too, even if you fucked up what you came to do there.

Still, if you don't participate in that gentilesse, the french seem mean, and they are, because to them, you are the mean one.

so what do you think happens in a culture where being friendly is so important, of course, love comes much easier.

The  french work to live, that has some truth to it l  I suppose, , we have a  saying in belgium about people who live a life of leisure, we say ' he  lives like god in france'.",0,2416,437

"Ratched is a terrible showthis show is absolutely trash, let me break it down. 

Mildred ratchets character can't be pinned down, it's like watching someone with multiple personalities do meth.  

EVERYTHING and I mean EVERYTHING just magically seems to go her way. The social interactions in which she tries to take control of people or situations is completely   ludicrous, especially for a woman in the 50's. 

The revolving door of mental patient's and their stories are poorly written and just cringy acting all around. At multiple points throughout the series i found myself wondering what was the point of 5 minute + scenes of side character mental patient's screaming when it did nothing at all for the plot. It seemed like it was mostly just filler due to the lack of an actual descent story. 

around the fourth episode it was so bad i turned it off because i was mad at myself for wasting my time watching it. but like a moth headed for the flames I had to turn it back on just to finish the train wreck of acting and writing that this show is.

"Missing Skip Forwards/Backwards 10 Seconds Controls On LG Smart TV Netflix AppI honestly don't know why Netflix didn't add a proper skip forward/backward 10 seconds feature, because it's such a vital one. I know the left and right arrows let you skip forward/backward, but it doesn't work properly. Firstly, it pauses the video on left/right press, so you have to press 2 buttons (left/right + play) just to skip back. Secondly, you can't actually skip backwards or forwards just 10 seconds, because when you skip forwards/backwards once and press play, it simply resumes where you were without skipping. This means that you have to skip backwards/forwards at least 20 seconds, which is pretty annoying.

"Thoughts on Rebecca? I absolutely ADORE Daphne du Maurier‚Äôs gothic classic Rebecca. I think the alienation and isolation that du Maurier crafted for the new Mrs. de Winter throughout the book are incredibly masterful, and her narrative is full of rich symbolism and subtle characterization that drives forward her plot. The suspense and agony that I, as the reader, felt throughout the book has landed this book at the top of my all time favorite list so I was excited to see that a new adaptation had been announced, if not a little skeptical, because I thought the the plot would serve a film well. 

I have just given up on the film after fast forwarding through most of the scenes in Monte Carlo and the initial scenes at Manderley. I feel as though 1. There are so many details that are either missing or changed that have really altered the tone of the movie and the depths of the characters and 2. So far, the characterization of Maxim and Mrs. de Winter have been flat and lifeless as well as particularly dissimilar to their characters in the novel. Gone is the mysterious angst of Maxim and the naive innocence of Mrs. de Winter has been portrayed as fear of all things. 

That being said, I‚Äôm wondering if other fans of the novel have watched the film and what your impressions are? Should I give it another shot? Does the adaptation start to feel more like the book as time passes?",0,1393,251

"Dear Netflix, Please reduce length of Unsolved Mysteries episodes by at least half.My wife and I both grew up watching the series when it originally aired back in the late 80s/early 90s. I loved the original series and that they‚Äôre trying to bring it back but am disappointed that they have taken a modern true-crime doc approach. 

After watching season 1 and half of season 2 I can say episodes need significant editing. Like most modern true-crime docs these stories can be told in half the time and without all the long, silent, panning shots of landscapes or silent vacant stares. 

Get to the point, give us the facts, and move on. I don‚Äôt need an hour of 12 different people telling me how it affected them.",0,714,127

"Netflix on an older device (iPad4)Im sorry if this is not the correct place to ask a technical question, but I believe it is a pretty simple one: 
I recently downloaded Netflix on my iPad 4 and since its an obsolete device by now (runs ios 10), when I downloaded the app, it downloaded the latest compatible version of it. 
I fine with it and it work well, but a few movies and series (like ‚Äúenola holmes‚Äù or ‚Äúda 5 bloods‚Äù) I cant actually watch them, since only the respective trailers show up, not the full movie/series. Why? Is it simply because my device is too old? Its weird because more recent movies and series they show up just fine.

"How are people feeling about the new David Letterman show ""My Next Guest Needs No Introduction?""I just started watching the show and I like it for the most part because I am learning more about the people he has as guests that I didn't know before. But there are a couple of things that are hard for me to get over in order to continue watching the show. 

\- How out of touch he is with technology and how much society has changed. He keeps asking basic questions that the younger audience already understands which I feel like we the audience are then deprived of more intriguing questions because of it. He keeps playing the ""I'm old"" card and it just doesn't work, especially when something like social media is a big part of someone's life and brand such as with Kim Kardashian.

\-How much he rambles when asking questions and how it isn't often clear what he is asking. Then he has to repeat himself in a different way. It's annoying to constantly watch him fumble over what he is trying to say and really brings to light how out of touch he is with certain topics.

\- Lastly, it really bothers me that he is constantly interrupting the guest when they are trying to answer him. He keeps interrupting with side stories of his own and it makes the show feel more like a conversation between his guest and a grandpa that says ""back in my day...""

Idk. It's just annoying to see interviews go like this when there are so many other great talk show hosts/ interviewers who are already doing a great job. People that at least have a basic knowledge of how society is today along with allowing the guest to speak like they are supposed to.  

In no way am I degrading Letterman and his past work, but I do feel like his time of doing on-air interviews are sort of over. He can't keep up with how fast things are changing which is extremely necessary in this day and age in order to have good and meaningful interviews with the younger generations of today. What do you guys think? Am I alone in feeling this way?",0,2014,373

"Does Bly Manor get scary?I get it, they're haunted by their pasts and the ghosts in our minds are the true ghosts or whatever, but man, it doesn't a horror movie make. 

Like, I don't understand what's so vital and interesting about the deadbeat uncle having an affair with the wife who passed away, yet there's an entire episode devoted to that plot point. Meanwhile, there's a *faceless zombie woman* who periodically walks through the house and kills anyone she crosses. That, to me, seems to be the most pressing issue the inhabitants face, not the cook's dead mom or the budding lesbian romance. By far the scariest part of the show was where she showed up and killed Peter, and then the next episode barely references her at all.

I mean, what? Am I crazy, or does the faceless zombie woman deserve a bit more attention in the script than the ""You are the father!"" plot point? 

And just as an aside, why does Miles know about ""keys"" in a flashback that takes place before Peter tells him about them?",0,1006,181

"Need help resolving Netflix video distortion issue on AndroidLg Velvet, Android Version 10.

I just got this phone a few weeks ago and now it randomly distorts all of my Netflix streams and downloads. It doesn't matter if I'm on WiFi, 5G, or offline thru downloads, every movie or show I try to watch distorts like the images below.

* No other video does this on my phone. Not YouTube, not Insa stories, not my own camera recordings. It's only Netflix
* I've deleted the files, uninstalled Netflix and reinstalled. The problem persists.
* I have tried watching streams and downloads on other profiles on my account, same problem.
* Any other device tied to this account streams just fine. Xbox, wife's iPhone, kids tablets, etc.
* All apps and systems are up to date.

"Serious in-accuracies and issues with AWAY‚ÄúAway‚Äù presents itself as a realistic space show, however... any casual viewers should be deadly aware of the following inaccuracies and issues with it:

- The crew has severe trust issues. Any such issues with real astronauts would be identified and ironed out during years of prior training
- For the first half of the journey, the crew uses video chats to talk with their families back on Earth with NO signal delay. Transmission is instant across the vast distances, ignoring the fundamental limit at which radio waves (and light) can travel 
- A crew member who has never been to space is going straight to Mars. Doesn‚Äôt even have his astronaut wings. He starts off as a liability
- The space suits (EMUs) do not have cameras on them, which are essential for ground control to see exactly what‚Äôs going on
- EVA suits do not carry means of emergency propulsion, despite the low manoeuvrability of the external hull
- The crew members frequently ARGUE with ground control... more so with each other.... they all have poor chemistry. The ship becomes a toxic workplace, which is fatal for any long duration mission  
- The crew cannot speak Russian, only the Russian astronaut can. The two official languages in space are Russian and English, ALL astronauts must know them 
- The ship is poorly designed so that if even a single solar arrays fails... the mission is doomed to run out of electricity 
- The crew starts experiencing the adverse effects of being in microgravity far sooner and with more intensity than real astronauts. Even though they spend most of their time under centripetal motion and can experience some gravity
- They rarely go into technical detail on how on-board systems go wrong. This makes the plot more convenient, but less believable 
- They are reliant on supplies launched separately for when they get to Mars. These should have been sent and established autonomously PRIOR to the beginning of the mission. Not when they‚Äôre almost there and things can go wrong. ‚ÄúThey couldn‚Äôt leave it in the dust and storms‚Äù is not a valid excuse. Rovers and their delicate samples survive on Mars for DECADES through ‚Äúdust and storms.‚Äù
- They risk drilling a hole from the inside of the ship to get to the water stored in the hull. Even though there is shown to be a valve for this on the outside. The fact that there is no internal valve for emergencies... eludes me

As I said, the show aims to portray itself as realistic. I understand that they have to introduce problems to the narrative to make it interesting... but they‚Äôve sacrificed extortionate amounts of said realism to do so. The movie Gravity, is still the worst offender of this by comparison. The writers punched too far above their weight with this one 

The Martian and Mars (Nat Geo) are much more realistic... and yet, they are still way more compelling than Away",0,2893,501

And now, because I fall asleep to Netflix on my phone, my phone screen is on nonstop and I'm just eating all that data for 8 hours or more while I sleep because the message no longer pops up.   

It might be worth mentioning that I'm on a shared family account, and I don't recall ever seeing a message about ""don't ask me again"" or anything like that. So maybe a family member did on their profile, and that makes everyone on the account no longer see the pop up. I'm not sure.

"Has Netflix cancelled any serialized non-anime animated shows on a cliffhanger?Offhand, I can't think of any.

The only questionable example I can think of is The Hollow, which vaguely teases something at the end, but in a way that almost feels more like a weird Easter egg of some kind than a true cliffhanger in light of the show ending at that point.

"Hill House v Bly ManorI have just finished watching ""The Haunting Of Bly Manor"" and I have watched ""The Haunting Of Hill House"" twice - first when it came out, and again later, because I thought it was so damn good.

I am by no means dictating which one you should think is better; I just want to communicate some of my thoughts comparing the two, and explain why I prefer Hill House.

In no particular order, I'll briefly talk about some of the main factors.

**Characters**

Bly Manor has some great characters. Dani and Hannah seem initially to have very interesting stories, with the bright-eye ghost in the mirror, and Hannah's strange discombobulation at the beginning of all her scenes (also, as a side note, the fact that she was dead wasn't particularly a twist - maybe it wasn't meant to be, but it was kind of obvious early on - at least, me and my family guessed early on). The kids are kind of creepy and make for good scenes/creepiness. In fact, all of the characters are good, and really well-acted.

However I think that these characters don't go together as well as in Hill House. They are all kind of individual and their personal stories are given much less attention, I thought. The thing with Dani's fiance is promptly solved after a few episodes, and Henry's story, for example, I thought was rushed over somewhat, and the whole thing with his two personalities didn't reappear after one episode focused on him.

When I watched Hill House, I got the feeling that I knew all of the characters really well. Maybe it was that, although each character had an episode dedicated to him/her, there was still attention given in other characters' episodes. All of their personalities were fully explored and the continuity felt therefore stronger to me. Also, the fact that the characters were related created more close-knit, intimate relationships and higher stakes.

**Spookiness**

Bly Manor's ghosts are also decent. The doll-face ghost(s) are creepy to look at but I think that the effect wears off after seeing them so much. There aren't really any more; just background ghosts such as the plague doctor and the soldier(?) who existed only as a consequence of the doll-face ghost. There is also a more noticeable reliance on jumpscares, I think.

In my opinion, Hill House was able to sustain tension and horror more effectively, such as the beginning of episode 1. Also, there were fewer jumpscares and those that were there often created lasting mental images (the dad's face elongating, for example).

**Complexity/Story**

I thought that Bly Manor left a few loose threads, like why the children forgot all the events. It was all tied up too neatly at the end - i.e. there was a happy marriage with all the main characters, concluding everything quickly.

All the features of Hill House came together smoothly. The resolutions were great, including the identity of the Red Room, the ghosts of the past, the intertwining stories. It felt like Bly Manor tried to replicate the latter with the whole dream-hopping thing, but for me, it wasn't as mind-blowing. The revelation of Nellie being bent neck lady was jaw-dropping.

I didn't mind that Bly Manor presents a story that has happened in the past, but the lack of this kind of storytelling in Hill House raised the stakes a little for me, and made things less predictable. Also, how did Jamie know of all of these intricate details and events?

Also, the climactic events in Bly Manor were not as dramatic as in Hill House. The showdown at the lake and the deaths were all glossed over in my opinion. And Henry just sprang back to life at the end? I found that a bit strange - it wasn't because of Dani's sacrifice, because if he was dead, then he would have stayed so - his ghost would have simply ceased to be. In general the through-line of Hill House and its instigating events held more weight for me.

**Emotion** 

Obviously emotional perception is subjective, but I would just like to briefly say that Hill House was a tear-jerker. Although the final episode was quite romantic, it was still really sad, especially that bit where Mr. Dudley carries his wife to the house just as she is dying. And all of the kids have goddamn traumatic pasts.

Bly Manor is quite emotional but the deaths aren't as horrifically tragic or such a punch to the gut.

&amp;#x200B;

So that's basically why I prefer ""The Haunting Of Hill House"" to its cousin. I think that it nails the horror, the emotion and the beauty (the cinematography!!) and Bly Manor does some of these things well, but not with the novel genius of its predecessor. I reiterate: this is my opinion! You are of course completely free to disagree.

"Trigger Warning: Grand High\*\*Mild spoiler alert\*\* Some of you may already have started the new show on Netflix, Grand High. I started the season last night and was LOVING the show-- I might be in my late 20's but I still love that high school drama!

The reason for my post is that, while the show addresses many NEED-to-be-addressed topics, it gets very real very fast. I became a fan of Joey straight off the bat and loved her relationship with her group of guy friends. She is this strong, independent beautiful character. 

In the third episode, there is a graphic, long rape scene which left me physically ill and reeling. I had to turn the show off, and I have not been able to return to it.

While I thought the show was great originally, I feel that it needs some kind of trigger warning to go with it. I completely understand that this was a strong scene and there is significant meaning behind it. But I'm left pretty destroyed by it and literally cannot move on with my day.

I wanted to reach out to any of you who may also have been left spinning and see if everyone is OK. AND, if you continued to watch the show, does it get better?",0,1151,215

"Does anyone have any explanation for the movie Handsome? (2017)So I was looking for a movie to watch on my new 4k television with my family and I find this Jeff Garlin film that looks very enjoyable to watch. I had never seen it before but I am a fan of some of the actors in the film so I decided to watch it. After watching it holy crap are there a lot of questions left unanswered, but that's not even the half of it. Many scenes and sections served 0 purpose at all and just existed to fill up time. In spite of this, it feels in fact like things were actually cut out leaving me on a rampant search for answers for no avail. No online forums can be found after 20 minutes of searching so I've broken down to make a reddit post to ask you guys

&amp;#x200B;

\- What was the deal with the Natasha Lyonne character hooking up with the fireworks guy? The scene was uncomfortable to watch and didn't get touched on later besides to make another joke about it

\-Why did we care about his retirement papers at all? It was brought up twice much like my last complaint and I believe the joke was just to put the Princess Carolyn character into the film.

\-What was the point of the backup crew to Handsome? He had a team of \~8 detectives working with him who all but one disappear 20 minutes into the movie never to be seen again

&amp;#x200B;

While I enjoyed the main plot and the main plot only it was unfun to watch a good 25 minutes of scenes that were either uncomfortable or completely pointless to the plot or viewership.

"Social Distance Anthology- I gotta complainI started watching this show today on Netflix. First episode was pretty good. The writing and the acting was meh, but interesting enough to keep my attention. 

The second episode was terribly written though. As someone from a hispanic family, especially as a 1st gen American, we do not talk like this. No latina/o I know interjects their english statements with ""pero"" or starts a sentence in Spanish and ends in English (unless they don't know how to say the word/phrase in Spanish).

The actors were all latino/a. The director is latino. But the writers were all white.  Not one latino/a writer to contribute and say this is not how people actually talk. This dialogue sounded so unnatural and for me it took away from the representation on the screen. If we're actually gonna have real representation why not go for authenticity when writing dialogue even if it will alienate some viewers (even though it shouldn't since subtitles are a thing, or they could have just had the entire conversation be in English since presumably everyone except Uncle Tony was 1st gen.)",0,1115,187

Then there's the Germany episode where he's talking to a guy in prison for breaking someone's jaw, the guy tells him that he has bad anger issues, and then Raphael Rowe goes on to basically tell the guy that he has a very off-putting demeanor and the guy is like ""wtf okay..."".

During this pandemic, I tried to stay creatively productive, and thus, I began a web series called Virtual Buddy with Kevin.

[Virtual Buddy with Kevin - Season 1 Poster](https://preview.redd.it/zkaelr6jclt51.png?width=1587&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a597db58daa143fc6544cb14dcce078292f7516e)

The show is about a 21 year old guy who tries to make an online ""buddy"" service even though he has no qualification or the emotional maturity to do so.

For the format, I was inspired by Lisa Kudrow's Web Therapy, and as for the style of comedy, I was mostly influenced by Mike Schur, Greg Daniels, and Liz Marryweather.

"Kipo, and unrecognized masterpiece.I‚Äôm going to be entirely honest... I was not interested in Kipo going in, I thought it‚Äôd be weird, but I enjoyed it. I gave it a break in season 1 to finish She Ra (I will never regret that decision by the way) and eventually came back to it. I didn‚Äôt enjoy it as much as She Ra until I realized that my brain was just looking for another She Ra... but then I realized something that changed everything. Kipo is not She Ra, only She Ra is She Ra... but Kipo... is something entirely new and engaging.

Now that that‚Äôs out of the way, GO WATCH KIPO!! Kipo is one of the best and most unique animated series I‚Äôve ever seen, having sharp animation, enjoyable characters that play off each other perfectly,  a great message about non violence and peace (that actually worked and didn‚Äôt distract), And so much more. Kipo on the surface is just another ‚Äúoh we can all be friends, yay for peace forever.‚Äù No! Kipo is a well developed, optimistic but still logical, intelligently written and designed character. She tries to see the best in everyone, thinking that anyone can change for the better, and is always willing to give everyone a chance. A great contrast to the mutants on the surface who have basically been having turf wars for decades. The world is astounding and fleshed out to an insane degree, and the main villain is... no joke... MORE LAYERED THAN ZUKO!! I can‚Äôt reveal anything else without openly spoiling it. But here‚Äôs a good comparison, this is the How To Train Your Dragon of Dreamworks cartoons. (I know Httyd has multiple shows, but it‚Äôs the best analogy I could think of.)",0,1626,292

According to [Netflix's own surround sound page](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/110881), titles supporting 5.1 should show an icon on the description page. But, on the mobile app, I don't see those icons anywhere, on any title. And if I play a film that I imagine should have it, the language selection options only list stereo.

 I understand the game was a popular one but there are much better games with much better lore and story telling out there like Dragon age or Warhammer 40k and there are pretty and Netflix nailed it with game adaptations before as we've seen in the awesome Castlevania.

Never mind that, the first two episodes made it seem like something was going to happen but it's been so long into the series and they haven't even introduced a plot? As far as I can see it's basically less about a haunting and more about some woman babysitting a bunch of weird kids. Nothing scary has happened at all.",0,636,118

Hello r/netflix!

Back at the start of September I created [**r/BarbariansonNetflix**](https://www.reddit.com/r/BarbariansonNetflix/), an English subreddit for the German Netflix Original **historical drama** [Barbarians](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9184986/), a show I am really excited about. It will be realised on **October 23, 2020**.

"The Haunting of Bly Manor was a total failureLet me just say beforehand that Hill House was absolutely flawless to me. Incredible storytelling, excellent writing, stellar cast and directing. It was an intensely emotional and often genuinely stressful ride. 

Bly Manor is a poor attempt at replicating it. 

Honestly ? It's just really bad. Very early on you just know that they have nothing to say, that the show is going nowhere, actually running in circles. It's one of the most redundant and repetitive shows I've ever seen. The pacing is off all the time because it's constantly dragged out, scenes that shouldn't even be in the final cut last for what seems like forever, it's extremely slow and tedious. On top of that, it's very predictable and kind of clich√© ? By episode 3/4 you already figured out everything there is to know but they just keep on explaining stuff and revealing stuff that you already know. It's expository as hell and it's really disappointing considering the quality of the writing on the first season. The characters are very one dimensional, some storylines are useless, some episodes are useless too. By the end when it should be at its climax, everything fell flat because I had no emotional ties to any character : they're just not interesting... at all. 

Everything else is great though, which is all the more frustrating. The cast is incredible, the directing and cinematography are great, it's a gorgeous show (albeit very dark, I often barely saw anything on the screen..) with a great score but oh so shallow and devoid of any emotion and substance. 

I'm very, very disappointed. I was skeptical when they announced another season was coming and it seems they proved me right.

"To The LakeHi r/netflix! I'm a new member of the family. I've got to say that recently I've been binging a new series called ""To The Lake"". It's a Russian netflix original series produced by premier studios. The characters are memorable, the plot is entertainingly original, and best of all is that it supports english dub and sub. (Note: I whole-heartdly recommend watching it in it's original russian to help capture the emotions originally conveyed in the series.) All in all, a great series to watch if you're in between shows, want something a little more action packed, want to support indie film developers, or are simply a fan of zombie thrillers, I whole heartedly recommend giving this show a try.

TL:DR ""To The Lake"" is a sweet new series on netflix.",0,762,132

It was a Chinese (Mandarin) tv show regarding death. Each episode was independent of the storyline.

I can only recall the plot of a few episodes. In one of them, there are two girls trying to return a report to a detective or investigator. The investigator is a young male who is browsing online when the girl comes into the precinct and turns in the form. He notices her ankle before she leaves and it turns out he is later killed by her as she runs him over at a specific time. After dying, he wakes up and relives the entire day again. He tries to change the sequence of events to prevent the girl from killing him again, but he is unable to. It turns out that even the girl is aware she‚Äôs trapped in the time loop as well.

There‚Äôs another episode that revolves around the lives of two children living in an apartment. The young boy is the son of the landlady and the young girl is the daughter of the tenant. The two kids go to school together but one day the girl finds a kitten and wants to adopt the kitten. The boy is against it because his mother forbids animals in her rental complex. It turns out the young girl is abused at home because her mother is some kind of drug addict and happens to overdose herself to death. The young girl uses kitty litter to prevent the smell of the decomposing mother but the smell of death overpowers the entire housing area and the police are called.

"Netflix disconnects my external monitorI bought myself a dock station ( ICY BOX IB-DK2106-C ) for my laptop (Dell XPS 13 (9370), Win 10) and external monitor (Philips 327R8QJAB). Dock and laptop are connected through USB-C, the dock and monitor through HDMI cable. Everything worked without any problems, but then when I started Netflix app, the monitor almost immediately disconnected. I found similar thread on this subreddit, but it wasn't any help, since I tried manipulating with refresh rates of both monitor and laptop screen, as they said in the other post, but it didn't work at all. When I close the Netflix app, the monitor is back up and working perfectly in a few seconds. I've tried launching Netflix through Chrome and Firefox with exactly same results - when I open the Netflix site, the monitor just disconnects. When I close the tab with Netflix (not even the entire browser, just the single tab!), it's working again flawlessly.  
While searching for answers, I found little workaround, with switching the display setting only to use the laptop screen, launching Netflix and then allowing the external monitor to be used too, which works fine, but you need to do it every time you start Netflix, which is really annoying.  


I wasn't able to find any relevant or useful information about this error, apart of this workaround and few mentions about HTCP handshakes as some sort of authentication when using external monitor to which I wasn't able to find any trustworthy info in relation to Netflix.

"Netflix keeps charging my Citi mastercard, even after changing my card number (twice!)I had a fraudulent Netflix charge on my Citi mastercard in July (I have a Netflix account but it‚Äôs paid via iTunes billing). I called Citi, disputed the charge, and got a new card number. A few weeks later, I got another Netflix charge on my card (different amount this time). I called Netflix and they said there was no account associated with either my current or previous card number (how is that possible?). I called Citi, disputed the charge, and got yet another new number. This time, Citi also disabled some MC feature that provides new card number to recurring billing merchants like Netflix.

To my surprise, I got yet another Netflix charge on my 3rd card. Spoke with Netflix agent, who said there‚Äôs no Netflix account associated with current or two previous card numbers. How can this be?

I did notice that every Netflix charge shows up on [Citi.com](https://Citi.com) as ‚Äú[NETFLIX.COM](https://NETFLIX.COM) ... **DIGITAL ACCOUNT NUMBER XXXXXXXXXXXX1234**‚Äù (it‚Äôs actually not 1234). It suggests Netflix is using some sort of a token or virtual card number associated with my card to bill, rather than my physical card number. So maybe changing my physical card number is having no effect? I‚Äôll call Citi so they can revoke any tokens, virtual card numbers, Apple Pay, Google Pay, or Samsung Pay associated with my card, but how do I get Netflix to stop charging my card? I don‚Äôt have the full Digital Account Number ([Citi.com](https://Citi.com) only shows last 4 digits), so it‚Äôs impossible to locate the fraudulent Netflix account?",0,1631,268

If if you watch a certain actor/actress a lot, they will try to find a thumbnail with that person to make you more likely to view that content. If you watch a certain genre a lot, they will try to find a thumbnail that goes along with that genre.

"Netflix app on Google Pixel phone won't let me stream in HD despite having a Standard HD planHey guys,

I have a standard HD Netflix plan. In the last couple of months, idk what has happened, but now the Netflix app on my Google Pixel 3 phone won't let me stream in HD and will only let me watch stuff in SD.

In the ""Playback Specification"" section of the Netflix in-app settings it says that my ""Maximum Playback Resolution"" is ""SD"" and it also says ""None"" under ""HDR Capabilities"".

I contacted Netflix today by phone and they said they couldn't do anything and that it's a problem on my end.

I have done a software update or two for my phone over the last couple of months so I have a bad feeling that somehow that's stuffed the Netflix app up. The weird thing is I can still see videos in full HD on other apps like YouTube, it's just Netflix that won't let me stream in HD. 

Any advice/help would be appreciated.

"I'm thinking of Ending Things (2020) - Story About Trans Person?Jakes is real and Lucy/Ames is who he wants to be, a trans woman.

I'm watching this right now, but I'm getting strong vibes that is what's being portrayed. Anyone else thinking the same?

Lucy/Ames is the woman that Jake really feels like inside. Jake never went through with his desire to transition because of the social stigma of his family and the small town or ""farm"". This is heavily hinted at with &gt;!the picture of picture of Jake from childhood, and the fact that Jake loves musicals. Oh and what about the fact Jake seems to know her thoughts?!&lt;

I'm sure there are plenty of other examples that I could list, but it's late and I just wanted to see if I'm the only person who thinks this is obvious? I guessed this relatively quickly into the film, roughly 20 minutes in.

Right now they are dancing around in the school and I'm just like wtf. I was expecting this to be scarier, but either way it's not bad. Just a little predictable if my interpretation is correct. Also, gotta say that Toni Colette did a great job in my opinion.

I own a 4K hdr tv. I saw google has a bundle of the new chromecast with google tv that offers 6 months free of Netflix. The new chromecast can cast in 4K and hdr. However, the 6 months free of Netflix is the standard HD plan. Not the Netflix 4K hdr plan. Would this eliminate the 4K hdr purpose? Using the Netflix standard HD plan google is offering for free would it play in 4K hdr?

It doesn‚Äôt make sense google is selling the new product 4K hdr capable but yet offer the standard HD plan on Netflix.

Would it be better to purchase the new chromecast and add the Netflix 4K hdr plan to get them most out of it?

We have tried force stopped google play services.

Our wifi works fine we can open youtube on the same tv and play 4K videos with no buffering. The netflix account works fine, we can open netflix on our  phones and watch it there just fine.

"""I'm cancelling Netflix because the keep canceling shows"" - You don't get itIt's really not rocket science. 

There's a world outside of your fandom microcosm that you think is so big. 

If show, which costs money to create (like shit load) will either bring in more subscribers or significantly affect current subscriber count if it was dropped then the show stays. Because Netflix is a business and obviously the subscriber count is the currency the care about. 

If a show, again it cost money to make, has no affect on subscriber count whether it is there or not (in any significant way) and it is not bringing in new subscribers, then off it goes. 

It's that simple. Why make a thousands posts bout it and turn it into some stupid straw man meme? 

It's not about your hurt feelings, its just business. If the show wasn't good enough to create a profitable crowd why would any sane business keep paying to create it?",0,922,163

They say they it‚Äôs not worth the investment anymore. Well what about their users investment? They are paying netflix month after month only to not get the full service.

"Is cancelling shows that bad?I am playing the devil's advocate here for Netflix. I don't think cancelling shows  are necessarily that bad. I understand the frustration, particularly after a few seasons but if the numbers are not there why would Netflix continue with it. Netflix has ways been in the red far as I am aware so they can't keep pumping more money if the show fails to gather audiences. 

At least Netflix starts a lot of shows and tries all types and genres. They don't need to adhere to any cable censor board and follow any corporate formula to green light a show. Also a lot of shows should wrap up earlier before they lose their idenity and just trucks along for steady paycheque IMO. Even though I watched a lot more American shows, I think the british model of shorter or limited series isn't the worse idea.

One thing I agree that most the cancelled shows should have some closure. But sometimes even that can be debatable show to show.

My 3 big disappointments were Altered carbon, Santa Clarita Diet and Glow. But for AC I didn't like S2 and felt it was aimless and without an endgame. Same goes for GLOW. SCD seemed to have an end and I really wish Netflix could have done a bare minimum hour long finale.",0,1230,224

Here‚Äôs a little nice spooky movie for the kids during this Halloween Season and not just for the kids but for the grown ups asl well.

The movie is about a group of friends who live in Bronx , NY who are fighting to save their neighborhood from A cooperation moving in. Specifically their favorite bodega. The cooperation is also happen to be run by vampires. The movie starts off by a lady selling off her nail salon to some strange businessman after  some blonde dude sucks the blood out of them. The movie is sure interested taking horrors of gentrification and white supremacy. The vampires of the movie are a metaphor for these kinds of people. They are just trying to sink their teeth in and suck up the blood of all these poor neighborhoods.

"I‚Äôm parisian and I watched Emily in Paris...And as you might‚Äôve expected : it‚Äôs really bad. An accumulation of dumb and tired clich√©s, very poor writing, a lot of nonsense (a LOT..) and tired tropes galore. 
She struggles at first but by the end of every episode she just succeeds in everything, proving to be a much better publicist than the entirety of the very high standard french team (as if...). She just hooks up non stop, has every male at her feet (okay Lily Collins IS gorgeous but still). 
The fact that for 90% of the show she never leaves her neighbourhood is insane to me. True, it‚Äôs one of the most beautiful in the city but for a show with that kind of name I kind of expected them to go a bit further than that. 

I also hate the fact that she has a piss poor attitude, doesn‚Äôt bother learning the language at all, tries to make everything bend to her will and her ways. Come on sis you‚Äôre on a different continent, you can‚Äôt expect everything to be the same as it is at home. But tbf this part was pretty realistic, it‚Äôs pretty much how most americans behave when they come here. 

There were so many dumb and very uncomfortable stuff, like the way the french characters just speak english all the time. It just makes no sense and while I get that it‚Äôs supposed to ease the flow of the dialogues, it‚Äôs just so weird to me watching 2 french actors playing french characters, casually speaking english with each other for no reason. 
The fact that it‚Äôs so sexualized was also very uncomfortable to me : no, not all french men are womanizers ??

Overall I just found it ridiculously bad and was almost ashamed that they had the nerve to produce this in 2020 even if it is kinda entertaining. If it wasn‚Äôt for the very endearing and adorable Lily Collins, I don‚Äôt think anyone would‚Äôve watched that.",0,1813,335

Off the bat she isn't liked be her new Parisian office but once again get's lucky with an amazing first impression.

She has an extremely hot neighbour that becomes part of not two but three handsome lovers she has to choose from in the end.

Every episode is an element of something we've seen before, with the same arc where Emily is better off and wins everyone with her amazing wit and charm.

"Are there any stories with good stepparent vs bad bioligical parent?We all know the evil stepmother stereotype. As much as this is a tried-and-true stereotype especially in family filmsn I'm sick of it.

I have a few friends with the opposite - their step-parent has been nothing but supportive to them, compared to their neglectful selfish parent. The step-parent has bene more of a parent to them than their ""real"" biological parents ever have.

Sometimes marriages fail and having children to ""fix it"" never works. Sometimes a certain parent perpetually does bad, like cheat on their partners or side only with their own parents rather than understanding their partner, leading to a divorce. In such cases, I feel like kids shouldn't have their first expectations of a step-parent as a hugely negative one.

I believe I started watching when it was 2 seasons old, binged those, and had to wait for the next two. I enjoyed it throughout, but by midway through the 3rd season really wondered how they'd keep the narrative going.   


I'm really writing this because of the 4th season though, and specifically the last couple of episodes. They were honestly the most contemplative and tear jerking moments I've experienced in a show/movie. I guess I'm not really sure what to say here, as I can't get into specifics due to obviously not wanting to spoil anything. But my god. I'm still feeling it the next day. Last episodes changed it from a 6-7/10 to a legit 10/10 for me.

There are 5 seasons but each episode is just fantastic, I'm interested to know how many regions outside of the UK actually provide Misfits

"""Emily in Paris"" - so full of clichesI enjoyed the show for what it was at first, but I couldn't continue after episode 8.

It's just so full of cliches. And it follows the obvious ""American abroad"" storyline of so many other movies/shows.

The synopsis can be summed up in ""American goes to the old continent to do a thing, but the Europeans are too set in their old dusty ways to listen. American gets sad, then has a brilliant, creative idea that blows everyone away, so everyone loves them now. And, of course, everyone clapped"". But I didn't watch the end of the show so I don't know if everyone claps at the end...

And besides the cliches, it's more like a Disney show with a big budget. I have so many compliments, but I guess most of them are because I might be too European to get it. 

The thing that disappointed me the most was how superficial it is with the language barrier and the main character being an immigrant. There is much more interesting material in being an immigrant than how people are counting their floors. I mean, this show is what an American would think living in a foreign country would be like, probably, I don't know, but it definitely is not even remotely close to what the actual experience is.

Tldr: it's a Disney show with a bigger budget, don't expect to understand the experience of being an immigrant.",0,1345,245

"Any Netflix original series worth watching?As the title says, I have had some trouble lately finding anything worth watching ob netflix. And, I apilogize for my honest wording, the absolutely greatest part of Netflix originals is horrendous trash. 

I am not nescessarily searching for anything specific, but I at least want a good Catchy storyline to follow and/or some entertainment (great cineastic Shots, some action). I failed to find something like this in the netflix Originals so far. They tend to have a poor, flat storyline with actors so bad at acting and a cast so bad at producing the series, that it Breaks all immersion.

Stranger Things had a good season one but got bland After. It just feels like a stephen king ripoff (Just mix ""It"" with ""The Institute"" and sprinkle some other common fantasy/mystery themes on top. It is okay, but uninspired). Was hyped for the witcher as well, but what is this abomination of a story? Maybe one must have played the games to actually like it. (At least they got a competent actor for geralt)

So are there any high quality netflix originals where people actually put some effort into? (Please spare me with the SJW-Propaganda stuff. I want to relax After work, not change my gender and topple the bourgeoisie)

"The Outpost (2020) now streaming on Netflix and worth a lookI'm generally not a fan of the war films we've been seeing lately out of Hollywood, but a friend recommended Rod Lurie's The Outpost and it is definitely worth a watch. It tells the story of the deadliest battle in the Afghan war. Rather than get involved in the politics of the entire thing, Lurie (The Contender, The Last Castle) just focuses on the soldiers who are there and just want to do their time and get through the day. The last hour is pretty crazy with some intense battle scenes. Stars Caleb Landry Jones (who is fantastic), Scott Eastwood (who is a dead ringer for his dad), and Orlando Bloom.

"Password being consistently forgottenAnyone had a problem like this and if so know the cause and/or solution?

I watch Netflix via a smart PVR and was doing just that less than an hour ago, the device logged in with no problem. A little later, on my PC, I thought I'd do a search for a movie but on the login page my password was deemed incorrect. Once or twice I've had this and blamed Firefox for somehow adding a spurious space or something in the remembered login details, just logging in again got fixed it. Not today, so I did the password reset routine, put in a temp password for that then while still on the a/c page changed it back to the old one - it's a pain to enter a password on the PVR with no keyboard.

Just to check, in a fresh browser session, I tried logging in again but my new/old password was again rejected. Tested login via the PVR, initially that logged in but after a minute or so that got booted to a sign in page. So I did a password reset again and this time left a different password in place. New browser session, tried the login with the password I'd set up just a minute before and it was incorrect. All this being done via email with confirmations from Netflix about new sign ins and password changes coming in. At this point I'm giving up for the night but if anyone knows what the hell's going on here have at it, I'll catch up in the morning.",0,1381,265

"A discussion about MessiahMessiah remained one of the most controversial Netflix series. It is confirmed that the second season of Messiah is cancelled. I personally loved this series so much. I mean, I haven‚Äôt seen a story like this before (maybe I don't watch much). 
It really makes me sad that the interest I've got into the Messiah series won't come to an end because of not having a final season of it. It was religiously controversial. But I would love to see a day where people will watch &amp; judge an entertainment program without sticking to their root.

Have you guys watched Messiah? What's your thoughts on it?",0,625,109

"American Vandal' s Season 2 was Amazingly Entertaining!!!In my last post, I had expressed about how I was thrilled by Season 1 of 'American Vandal'. The show demeanor as if it is a true crime documentary which wasn't. Now, I finished watching Season 2 yesterday, and I can't choose which season was better. The two seasons are both engrossing and brilliant by their own voice. 

The character Kevin was humorously so upbeat and brazen that I don't know whether I would say Dylan or him, who between the both was best. They were equally prodigiously eccentric for me. But I liked Kevin more. Oh and of course, Peter and Sam - these two characters were wonderfully great in Season 2 like they were in the previous season - but in Season 1 I think the duo was much more highlighted of their rigorous antics than it was shown in season 2. 

Season 2 illuminated the blind side of social media that most of us drown into believing something that we desperately want something to exist. While it was comical, it did put a social message lucidly. Out of curiosity, I googled to see if season 2 was anyway based on some true story. So no, it isn't. Although, the creators came up with the inspiration of eliciting a dark comedy by watching various true crime documentaries. 

There will be no season 3 which is kind of bummer. But the mockumentary series is worth recommended to watch. It has every punch that one can get glued to so easily. I mean 'American Vandal' is truly a good binge watch worth.",0,1493,269

"Google Assistant / Roku Voice SupportIs Netflix supporting voice commands via Google Assistant/Roku yet?

It's been two years ([per this CNET article](https://www.cnet.com/news/roku-streamers-and-tvs-now-work-with-google-assistant-devices/)) since Google Assistant support launched on Roku, but Netflix is still not supported. Saying that it won't be supported is not actually solving the issue.

What happened?So, I just got Netflix again after cancelling it because of that movie, and long and behold, the most popular thing on Netflix that isn't an original series is Ninjago. Is the show surging in popularity? Because in Australia, Netflix only has seasons 1, 8-11. So it's missing out on a large chunk of the show, as well as (in my opinion,) the best season, that being season 4. Seeing as it's popular, could Netflix get the other seasons?

"The Umbrella Academy Is A Netflix Original MasterpieceI took my time starting this one but it's genuinely so well made. Based on the comics by Gerard Way (the MCR frontman) it tells of dysfunctional superpowered siblings and an apocaylptic threat. With brilliantly observed humour gripping storytelling and 3 dimensional characterisation it's reccomended to viewers regardless of their appreciation of comic books or the superhero genre. The performances are excellent the cinematography sharp and cinematic and the soundtrack brilliantly chosen.

"What are the best sci fi films/series on netflix in your opinion ?I love scifi shows I will try to add a little description of my opinion without spoilers

IMO **the best are:** 

1. **Orphan Black** \- I loved how the story continue to develop and expand further through the seasons, its a surprise for me that it didnt become huge as other series.
2. **Dark** \- I like deep and complicated stories. At some point I think it was complex just for the sake of being more complex but is enjoyable to me to decipher the puzzle of the serie.
3. **Altered carbon** \- I like when stories happen in a such distant future that make us question our own reality. The 2th season isnt good as the first.
4. **Travellers** \- I wonder how it didnt become huge too because it had a lot of potential. Is shame it was cancelled after 3 seasons.

&amp;#x200B;

*They arent in any specific order of what I think is better than other.*

&amp;#x200B;

The worst are:

1. **The I-land** \- They tried to add too much references, too much information and the story end up a total mess with bad script and cheap cgi.
2.  **Another Life** \- Its not terrible but have some scientific absurds like a doctor doesnt know how to use a doctor tool.
3.  **Replicas**  \- Could have been a good movie but then ending is a big meh.",0,1301,242

"2 questions (things that bother me)why is it any time I use Netflix on my phone, when I get home and turn on Netflix on my TV English subtitles are on? I have to turn them off, exit and then come back and they seem to go away for good then. but yeah every time I use the phone app this happens. all I do with the app is browse and look for stuff to add to my list. never even touch any settings.

and then also me and my girlfriend have been wondering for months why when we're on the TV browsing, all the previews are super loud and clear. the volume only needs to be on like 13. but then when we pick any movie it's suddenly nowhere near as loud. we end up having to turn it up to 28, some times even around 35. in previews we can hear dialogue crystal clear no problem. then we pick that movie and when they talk we have to damn near be 3 feet away from the TV to actually hear them well. which sucks because if we turn it up loud enough to hear dialogue well, then any action scene or music is a bit too loud.",0,1013,209

Those cheap tvs have around 300 nit max brightness values and lets say the movie is mastered to 1000 nits. Then your tv tone maps and makes the average level way darker than it was supposed to be.

They will continually show the loading animation but do not do anything. I know it has nothing to do with my internet if every other show loads up in &gt;15 seconds. 
Is this due to the shared family accounts potentially watching the show at the same time or something? I am baffled as to why this is happening.

"Do you feel like Netflix¬¥s Top 10 Daily feature is rigged or not?The introduction of this feature earlier this year was not so necessary, but a welcome one that at least lets us figure out which Netflix originals are popular and mostly without waiting too long for the company to release some flimsy numbers to indicate the same. But there are some things that can make us believe that this feature might not be truly accurate to what people are actually watching.

Many times this year we¬¥ve seen news about which shows and movies end up being the most popular, with some of these being awful, schlocky movies like the live-action Avatar The Last Airbender, or that 50 Shades rip-off called 365 Days. Bad movies and TV series being in the Top 10 is what can lead people ot believe that Netflix is using this feature to only sell mediocre content to mainstream audiences, but sometimes they can have some good quality series appearing in a Top 10, like Umbrella Academy. Another one is that the feature only takes into account the content viewed in the Top 10 depending on each country, rather than taking into account which series are popular in the entire world.

I know the narrative of Reddit around Netflix is that they aren¬¥t giving people the exceptional best content people actually want to see and that defies conventional TV, but instead they¬¥re delivering the kind of average content that you¬¥d see on normal cable TV and that most don¬¥t want. And they could think this feature is another step to get more of the latter, but do you feel like the feature is rigged or manipulated exactly for that? Or it could be somehow accurate about if a series is truly popular?",0,1675,296

But now that I think about. It's not very good. Yes, tall girls can be insecure. Lots of people have days where they percieve themselves as unattractive. But in real life, those people have redeemable traits, and are much more than just ""tall"" ""short"" or whatever descriptor you give them. 

Jodi, the main character, has no redeemable traits and her only talent is playing the piano. She claims that she is ""more than just a tall girl."" But it's not like she has any other personality trait, other than complaining about being tall.",0,687,125

"Netflix censoring movies??Maybe I'm just being dumb, but I switched on Dead Silence on Netflix and noticed they made multiple cuts to the movie. Only reason I caught it is because I've got it on DVD and have seen it before. It's definitely not me having seen the ""uncut"" version and then the ""cut"" version. There never *was* a cut version of the movie to my knowledge.

Do they do this to other movies too? If so, what do they tend to censor, because I have no idea. It just doesn't add up... Especially if you consider the fact they've put out Cuties and 365 days without taking issue with it's content to the degree they believe censorship or cuts are necessary.

It wouldn't be that weird, or even a slight issue at all if they hadn't put out things that could be potentially harmful, while censoring other things that aren't very harmful, if at all. *Child exploitation and sexualisation? That's fine. Let's include all the close up crotch shots of children. Fictional murder being mentioned? Not allowed at all. Cut it. Not on this platform.*",0,1047,186

"Netflix talent considerationThis isn't a ""can i get on netflix"" type deal, but rather a question I've had for some months. With the recent success of Outer Bank among other netflix originals such as Stranger Things that all started with a film crew, writers, directors, and actors who had either no but productions under their belt or little to nothing under their belt but became huge stars over the platform, is Netflix slowly taking a shift toward preference of younger, more inexperienced filmmakers and actors to have a more appeal to the youth and youngish adult demographic (or regular adults who like low profile film and television)?

"I hate drama series that masquerade as documentariesSo this isn't specific to Netflix, but I think Netflix is perhaps the biggest culprit of this. I hate series that Netflix lists as documentaries which are not actually documentaries. They just take interviews with real people and/or real events, and then just lie through their teeth about what actually happened. Examples of this: *Making a Murderer*, *Fyre*, *Tiger King*. 

I think documentaries are a unique brand of television and film, because they, as opposed to almost all other tv/film media, are meant primarily not to entertain but to educate. So, when a person watches a documentary, they expect to be seeing fact and truth, or at least multiple perspectives about real events. They don't expect to see a story that has been heavily influenced or warped by the bias or desires of the filmmakers. By labeling these sorts of shows as documentaries, I feel like Netflix and other production companies and streaming platforms are actively deceiving their viewers. 

If a show or movie is meant first to entertain, then it shouldn't be labeled as a documentary. I think that's a good rule of thumb. A documentary is almost exclusively meant to educate. Any entertainment it provides is either a. utilitarian, simply as a way to keep viewers engaged; or b. a symptom of the subject matter being itself intrinsically interesting. 

When a show or movie has entertainment as its primary objective, rather than education and reality (or, in some cases when multiple people are saying different things, objective and unbiased presentation of facts); it means the filmmakers are free to (and often do) misrepresent events, timelines, and stories in the pursuit of a more interesting story. I don't see any difference between these types of shows and the murder porn crap that ID puts out.

**Tl;dr:** I think it's dishonest and deceitful for Netflix to label shows such as *Making a Murderer*, *Fyre*, and *Tiger King* as documentaries. I think people expect at most education and at least unbiased presentation from the filmmakers when they see something labeled as a documentary. I think the onus is on Netflix, as a platform for (and often financier of) these shows, to vet anything labeled as a documentary or docu-series.

I know the rules say any suggestions shouldn't be posted here, but I moreso wanted to rant about this. In politics, there's a lot of talk about misinformation campaigns, truth in media, and fake news. I feel like this is closely related. I love documentaries, and it angers me when I see people accept what they see in these types of shows as absolute fact. I get the same feeling of upset when people spout fear mongering crap that they heard on MSNBC or FoxNews. Just as those places aren't actually need just because they say ""news"" in their names, these types of shows aren't actually documentaries just because they call themselves such",0,2922,488

"Just finished The Social Dilemma and I think it's overratedI dislike Facebook, but I think this documentary is grasping at straws and fails to really focus on the real problem. Here are some things I wanted to point out.

1. The younger generations are using Discord, not Facebook. Facebook is dying to the younger generation. The skit in the video makes no sense because those kids wouldn't even have a Facebook account.
2. Yes, problems exist with Facebook, but they would happen in any other online forums/community. People will seek out false information that confirms their belief no matter the platform. We've seen people being brainwashed throughout history with traditional media without needing a platform like Facebook.
3. Conspiracy theories are wired differently. Facebook didn't make them that way. These people take pride in being the minority.
4. Adblock
5. Algorithms and Facebook feed copied how society works. They didn't invent anything new. This isn't a facebook problem. It's the problem with society that is magnified by the internet. 
6. Selling data and ads. I still don't get it after watching this documentary. If Facebook knows I get addicted because of a certain trigger and manipulate it, I'm fine with it. Example if Facebook knows I like a certain page and want to see it's update, so they purpose notify me about it. I'm fine with it.

My main problem is watching other people feeds don't make me happy, and that's why I dislike Facebook. It's not productive and really serves no purpose. Everything else feels exaggerated.",0,1555,257

Being surrounded by manuals, videos and tediously open conversations about sex, Otis has become a reluctant expert on the subject. When his classmates learn about his home life, Otis decides to use his insider knowledge to improve his status at school, so he teams with whip-smart bad girl Maeve to set up an underground sex therapy clinic to deal with their classmates' problems. But through his analysis of teenage sexuality, Otis realizes that he may need some therapy of his own.

"The Producers (2005) is currently available in the U.S. Here are my thoughts.This is based on a Broadway musical which was in turn adapted from the 1968 comedy of the same name. I watched that original film earlier today and then moved on to this one. Here are my thoughts.

As you probably expected, no, it‚Äôs not as good as the original. It‚Äôs much more light-hearted and frivolous than the original, which was rather cynical and biting with its humor. This version also features what many would likely consider a happy ending compared to that of the ‚Äò68 movie. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with any of that, mind you. But the problems begin with Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick. They‚Äôre competent enough, but their singing is meh at best and they don‚Äôt hold a candle to Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder.

However, although it‚Äôs not as good overall, I did enjoy it. For one thing, this is a musical first and foremost and I thought that (save for the one right before Springtime for Hitler premieres) all the songs were fun and enjoyable to listen to. I also really liked Uma Thurman in here, and her character is given a lot more to do than in the original. In terms of humor, the script actually recycles a great deal from the ‚Äò68 movie with greatly diminishing returns, but when they stop copying the other film and try to write some jokes of their own, it can be decently amusing. It actually elicited a handful of laughs from me, which was nice. Finally, many musicals sport lavish set and costume design, and this one is no exception. It‚Äôs quite the feast for the eyes in this regard. Now I leave it to you. What are your thoughts on this adaptation on its own and compared to the other movie and the musical it‚Äôs based on?",0,1719,313

"I Finished Watching Season 1 of American Vandal and it's Too Good to be True!I stumbled upon this series called American Vandal on recommendation by some user. I instantly got intrigued by it's synopsis and honestly, I thought it was a true crime documentary show. Until after two episodes, I learnt that it's not. The limited series is based on a true story but the show shot, looking like it's realistic, is actually fictatious. But it was awesome in every aspect. Right from the storyline, plot, cinematic scenes, cliffhanger and the characters, it was brilliantly made. What drew me the most was the relevance of real life picture of social media, anxiety, the need for social acceptance, popularity, attention, truth verses lies, as such - the crux of various phases that we all go through. The epiphany of episodes from the beginning till the end was exceptionally encapsulated. 

I can't wait to start with season 2! I read that this show didn't make through for season 3? I can only conclude after watching season 2. Otherwise season 1 alone is a masterpiece.",0,1067,182

However, I just really don‚Äôt like it as a prequel to One who Flew over the Cuckoos Nest. For starters, it felt more like an American Horror Story series then Cuckoos. I really enjoy Paulson, but I do think she seems a bit typecast as the weird occult freaky person.

The thing for me about Nurse Ratched which made her a villain was how real she is. She isn‚Äôt a psychotic supervillain, she‚Äôs cold and callous because of life. I always imagined her as having a very unremarkable life growing up, and it was her time as a nurse during WW2 that made her uncompromising and cruel, followed by being a cog in the medical institution for decades.

I just think the Nurse Ratched in the series isn‚Äôt the same character as the novel. I think it‚Äôs way too fantasy horror, and plays too much like American Horror Story. The crazy millionaire murder plot, and the whole brother and orphan situation just isn‚Äôt how I personally picture Ratched. By creating this outlandish backstory, it seems almost out of place that she ends up as the head nurse at a dysfunctional and dreary mental institution in Oregon. Ultimately, for me, I don‚Äôt think Netflix have been true to the source material. Ratched is a great character because of how real she could be, we all know of or can easily imagine a ‚Äúbattle-axe‚Äù personality, and I just don‚Äôt think this is true with Netflixs take on the story.

Be cool to know what everyone else thought, especially on Ratched as a character compared to the book.",0,1581,283

"Coneheads is available in the U.S and is a great time.It‚Äôs based on a series of SNL sketches and centers on a family of aliens who crash land on Earth and are forced to blend in with human civilization.

I saw that the Rotten Tomatoes score is only 35% and I‚Äôm not sure why. It‚Äôs very clearly not trying to be anything more than a goofy sci-fi comedy with some gentle ribbing at ‚Äò50s suburbia and U.S. immigration policy thrown in as well. On that level, I thought it fully succeeded with consistent laughs and some pretty decent prosthetics and CG for the time. It‚Äôs also only 86 minutes long and paced well so it goes by fast.

"American Vandal completely holds up to rewatchesI recently read somewhere that Netflix is trying to emulate the success of The Office by having something be infinitely rewatchable. They don't want to have to keep paying such high costs to renew their streaming rights for this show but they have nothing to offer in substitution of it. 

Their problem with hitting this mark is that very few of their series have the actual library to reach this point. The business practices they engage in shut things down enjoying anything but absolutely monumental levels of success to just two seasons. The true shame is that if American Vandal had gotten two or three more season then it totally could have been Netflix's own The Office.

American Vandal is funny, weird, engaging, and enjoyable but it's familiarity in presentation makes it easy to unwind with. It is easy to disengage from but even easier to pick back up. Having American Vandal on in the background while cleaning, cooking, or however it is that we all seem to watch The Office, is actually a really great experience. The characters are outrageous but consistent, the jokes are tight and funny, and the stakes are low. It could have been Netflix's next The Office, if it had made it past two seasons.",0,1259,216

"The Devil All the Time (2020) is well worth a watch. First netflix movie I've seen that's any good.Interesting story, languidly told, very un-hollywood and all the better for taking its own time. There's no redemption arc, no righteous vengeance to hang your hat on and give you an easy out. It's just unadorned, unflinching, real life sins-of-the-father stuff that sits uneasily but, in a marvel movie world, is refreshing as fuck.

Spiderman's Tom Holland is a revelation, Aussie Jason Clark again shows his range and Riley Keough is phenomonal.

It even has narration that's not a gimmick, is necessary and only adds to the story.

Pretty sure there's more to the subtext than I'm aware of, might even be a commentary on the state of hollywood itself I dunno.",0,762,130

"Do you wait for new seasons to pop-up before starting a series?For example, Enola Holmes, with Millie Bobby Brown (Eleven from Stranger Things) seems very promising. However, just a few episodes and I have to wait for a year to continue. I personally rather start a series that have a larger number of episodes already (\~3+). I recently started The 100 which is running it's 7th season, which is great.

I assume there is a nice split between 'early adaptors' of series and late joiners, so content creators don't have anything to fear (""oh, my series isn't being watched, because I don't have a large content base""). That said, I really wonder: Do you prefer to start series with a larger number of seasons already, instead of newly added series? Why or why not?",0,764,134

"A Perfect Crime (2020) - Rohwedder's assasinationHas anyone seen the new series on Netflix regarding Rohwedder's assasination? 

My personal take is that it is Stasi written all over it. But this is not why I'm making this post. 

Spoilers: in the context of many underperforming GDR companies and the restructuring that occurred after reunification, resulting in skyrocketing unemployment and a lot of anger, in the 3rd episode a guy named Kurt Hilmann appears... who used to work in the GDR Ministry for Foreign Trade and then for IMES, a weapon-exporting company (mostly AK-47s). This company soon was on the West Germany's and Rohwedder's radar, for its unorthodox practices and money laundering.

Towards the end of the episode, approximately at min. 29 mark, Hilmann tells: ""Where did we sell the weapons? Africa. South America."" and then looks briefly straight at the camera for about 2-3 seconds, with a deep-sharped look that raised my hair on both my arms.

"Hey, I want to eventually one day find out what's top 2 or 3 most worthwhile romcoms. Progress so far:&amp;#x200B;

Hey, I want to find what's the top 2 or 3 most worthwhile romcoms. Here's the progress so far:

**First is the goal:** The goal is to find what is the highest rated romcom according to user ratings

This is for romcom across all types of media (youtube, film, tv, theatre, everything else)

&amp;#x200B;

There's a few things I'm interested in finding out:

* What's best romcom of all time (this seems close to figured out based on the link below)
* What's most worthwhile romcom of last 20 years?
* What's most worthwhile romcom of last 10 years?

&amp;#x200B;

**step 1 -** i googled 'best romcoms' just to see if anything helpful would come up

* \* this was the most helpful, but i dont know if all of these are actually romcoms or just romance
* \* [https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/best-romantic-comedies-of-all-time/](https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/best-romantic-comedies-of-all-time/)

&amp;#x200B;

**step 2** \- from a question i asked previously in one of the sites on reddit (dont rememmber which), i looked at the 4 top 'best' voted comments/suggestions

&amp;#x200B;

**step 3** \- I sorted those 3 by user ratings

What's a high rating for film?

* Highly rated = 86 aggregated across all main rating sites (users + critics scores)
   * Examples (looking at my film google sheet): inside out, spirited away, boyhood
* Meh = &lt; 81
   * Examples: dunno i don't add those

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**These are movies, but tv is harder** cos there's not really any user ratings sites for tv. For tv i'd use:

* \* [http://www.showskimmer.com/?t=Married+At+First+Sight+%282014-%29&amp;n=25](http://www.showskimmer.com/?t=Married+At+First+Sight+%282014-%29&amp;n=25)
* \* [https://www.ratingraph.com/tv-shows/married-at-first-sight-ratings-53069/](https://www.ratingraph.com/tv-shows/married-at-first-sight-ratings-53069/)
* \* [https://tvchart.benmiz.com/silicon%20valley](https://tvchart.benmiz.com/silicon%20valley)

but that's only AFTER there are suggestions. I've no idea where these sites get their data from. Prob one of the tv ratings sites I guess

For tv it's a hard search cos I think all of them are lowly rated or something, but am still wondering what's the highest rated one?

&amp;#x200B;

**For tv, msot ppl (like 3..) had recommended ""Love on Spectrum"",** and this is what a users on r/AutisticPride and r/AutisticAdults had to say:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Love on Spectrum *isn't a romcom, it's a documentary series*. Mind you it's a good series, but it's not a romantic comedy (and if people are saying that it is because they were laughing at autistic people in series, then that's a problem).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I am not a fan of parent interviews as shown in Love on Spectrum, because if we are adults who don't need guardians any more, I don't think our parents' perspectives are as important as our own, and don't really merit inclusion.  
&gt;  
&gt;I can understand including perspective of guardians and caregivers if this series was about people with intellectual disabilities, because oftentimes people with intellectual disabilities do have higher support needs than autistic people do, and of course there are people with both disabilities too.  
&gt;  
&gt;If I were being interviewed for a series like Love on Spectrum, I would say that I'm an adult with a college degree and not to air interviews with my parents if they are interviewed at all. My perspective matters more than theirs in this case.

&amp;#x200B;

Film comment

&gt;Of all RomComs to have ever RomCom'd, ""When Harry Met Sally"" is probably ACME, final form of genre at its height. leads are charming and attractive but not unrealistically so. writing is excellent, performances top notch. It has to be observed carefully, though, because it will suffer a bit from Seinfeld syndrome. It is SO well known, SO much part of culture, that aspects of it look cliche' and overdone, but they're cliche and overdone because THIS FILM POPULARIZED THEM. ""I'll have what she's having"" line is so known and parodied and referenced that it's become its own 'thing' now, but let me tell you, when this was new in theater? That line fucking brought house down. It's hard to think of a better modern example of RomCom.  
&gt;  
&gt;But there's an OLDER one. Possibly one of ORIGINAL Romantic Comedies: Much Ado About Nothing by some unknown English dude named Shakespeare. It's blueprint for every modern romcom. Attractive, but VERY clever people dislike one another. They get involved in a zany plot to help two friends hook up. A villain tries to break things up because he's an ass. Misunderstandings and hilarity ensue. attractive clever people realize their hostility toward each other was masking a deep attraction. Revelations ensue. Ever afters become happy. end. There are others as well: Twelfth Night, Midsummer Night's Dream, Taming of Shrew all contain basic structure and a lot of elements of modern Rom Com.  
&gt;  
&gt;Jump forward a bit and you have Jane Austen: Emma Thompson's 'Sense and Sensibility', any number of versions of 'Pride and Predjudice', 'Emma' (including modern adaptations like 'Clueless!) are all worthy to various degrees.  
&gt;  
&gt;Even more modern, early Judd Apatow comedies like 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up are absolutely romantic comedies, just skewed more towards 'dude' direction than usual.

&amp;#x200B;

**I luv this film bot:** [https://www.reddit.com/user/cinephile\_bot/](https://www.reddit.com/user/cinephile_bot/)

* cos what it does is it takes the comments ppl put
* And then it makes/shows a chart with the ratings

Problem is these aren't user ratings, they're critic ratings

&amp;#x200B;

**Last is the goal:** The goal is to find what is the highest rated romcom according to user ratings

This is for romcom across all types of media (youtube, film, tv, theatre, everything else)

There's a few things I'm interested in finding out:

* What's best romcom of all time (this seems close to figured out based on the link above)

* What's most worthwhile romcom of last 10 years?

"Bit of A Netflix RantAlright, so I just came to this realization as I finished all of the available seasons for The 100 and started looking for new shows.

It seems as if Netflix keeps cancelling a lot of wonderful shows. I understand coronavirus and all, but canceling these shows does nothing but make them lose a lot more revenue. With that and the Cuties situation, I feel like the quality and integrity of Netflix is disappearing a bit. For me, if a show is cancelled/unfinished, I usually can't watch it. The only one I could stomach was The 100 because a) very cool concept that I loved and b) season 7 gets released on Netflix pretty soon.

I've found lots of Netflix seemingly good/interesting shows in the past 40~ minutes and, after googling about them a little bit (just to see if they're actually worth watching), find out they've been cancelled. The Rain, Sabrina the Teenaged Witch, Ozark, Money Heist, and a few others. Looks like I'm gonna have to some real digging tomorrow night. Well, if you have any good and (preferably) finishes Netflix series (I like sci-fi, fantasy, crime, genres like that).

"Can we talk about ""away"" (spoiler warning)I have been watching this show as of late, and while so far it is pretty decent I have to admit that some of the scenes bug me. I understand that some things have to be written in a way to add suspense. But do we really need to sacrifice logic in order to do so?

So shall we discuss the things that we like or h as te about this show?

Ill start. There are 2 specific plot points that bother me. Both dealing with water reclamation.

Ill start with the ep9 spacewalk scene. The plot point is that they have to use static electricity to attract the ice crystals and sort of funnel them to the other person by the door. really! Why is it so needlessly complicated. So much water was wasted in this scene. Why not collect the water at the source? Why use static electricity at all? Why not simply hold the bags in front of the ejection point and collect ALL of the water as it escaped? Nope. They have to create a pretty scene with water ice floating around cmdr green, And add a sense of complexity to the scene.

Secondly. Over a few episodes they are attempting to fix a water reclimation system. I have to say that dealing with space, The more complex something is the more points of failure it has. So to add a water reclimation system with 4000 intricate parts that are ALL unique doesnt make sense and would probably never be engineered into the space craft.

"Sarah Paulson is a bonafide badass in RatchedThe show is a departure from the source material. Had a little China Town vibe there upfront, then it goes it's own way and I appreciate the 'inspired by' notation. I don't think it does a disservice to the OG. The show is weird, fun, creepy and maybe slightly derails a bit, but Sarah Paulson is fantastic and makes it worth watching. Everyone else is killer. Not just throwing that in, they really are, but Sarah Paulson is truly a force to be reckoned with.",0,505,92
"how to change the account language?yesterday I changed the payment method from my mother's card to my card, but when I did I got an email in COMPLETE Arabic telling me that my payment method was changed successfully and so on, (i had my mom read it) 

I did some digging and apparently, there is a Netflix scam in different languages but that's not what im getting, mine was legit. so i went to the help center on the Netflix  and ITS ALL IN ARABIC because it's perceiving my mom's profile as the main profile (she likes Arabic shows so we set the language on her profile to Arabic)

While I am not really phased from whats on the tv my spouse gets extremly uncomfortable from scenes that display sexual violence or rape. General violence is not a problem at all, but when rape scenes come up I usually just shut down the movie/series and we watch something else because it causes her so much discomfort.

Its really annoying to watch through 2 seasons of a series and suddenly the producers decide that it would be a fun thing to explore sexual violence a bit more. (looking at you ""Dark""...) Why do so many modern series (especially on netflix) have rape scenes in them? Is there no other way anymore to envoke the viewers emotions?

I googled this before but the only thing that came up was a less than helpful tumbler blog and a website (doesthedogdie) that doenst have reviews for shows that we are interested in....

I resorted to looking through the wikipedia article of the plot so that doesnt happen anymore, but obviously that kinda ruins the tension.

"Dear Netflix! Please, stop forcing filmmakers to use this weird 2:1 aspect ratio.It's an open secret that most movie and series directors would prefer to shoot their work in one of the classic Cinemascope formats (2.35:1 or 2.39:1) in order to create a more immersive and a visually more evocative imagery and experience.

However, Netflix doesn't allow them to for the simple reasoning that most users watch their content on 16:9 displays therefore with a classic Cinemascope style movie/series, there would be too much black bars.

This is just a dumb reasoning. First of all, people who watch movies and series generally do not care about those black bars (especially nowadays, when most people have giant TVs), so you might as well let creators to actually do what they want and stop compromising their artistic vision. A lot of things only really work well if they get a wide enough frame.

Secondly, a lot of people watch movies and series on their phones and monitors. Phone screens get wider and wider while the PC users adopt to ultrawide screens more and more. Also, it's quite possibly based on recent news that thanks to Samsung's contribution, the new generation of Xbox consoles will support ultrawide aspect ratios (21:9 is roughly the same as the classic Cinemascope aspect ratios). And consoles usually drive the technological evolution of TVs so it's safe to assume that eventually ultrawide TVs will start to hit the market as well.

Therefore forcing creators to this 2:1 aspect ratio which is nothing more than just a nomansland and a compromise between 16:9 and 21:9 (2.35:1 or 2.39:1) instead of being a creator's choice is just dumb.",0,1657,278

"[Help] Samsung S5e no longer supported?Hello all,

As title states, I am running Samsung s5e on Android 9. I bought it new about 7 months ago, and netflix came installed on the OS (and as such cannot be uninstalled) Netflix ran without issue until a few months ago after an Android update, but it now says it is no longer supported on the device. 

I contacted Netflix customer service and they basically told me to buy a more up to date tablet. Super helpful. I searched reddit and this is obviously a common issue, but most of them seem to be on older models or rooted devices which would warrant Netflix not supporting them. 

I have tried external install  with .apk file, tried factory reset, contacted Google, Samsung and Netflix all of whom can't give me a straight answer.

Has anyone else had this issue with a relatively newish device or am I destined to not have Netflix until my next upgrade? (Not for another 3 years at least)

"Challenger: The Final Flight should be followed up by a documentary on the Columbia [SPOILERS]There are spoilers for the docu-series below

Before I dive into the subject of the title I think that the documentary was well done. I have always marveled at the space shuttle (and space in general) and even being born after this disaster the documentary made it very easy to see everything from that point in time, something TV-movies have not been able to do. It did not over dramatize anything and gave us the straight facts, lots of background on the shuttle program, and especially the seven astronauts from the perspective of family and friends and didn't deify them, but made them out as just regular humans doing their jobs. Some of the facts were unsettling, such as how some of the engineers were still wracked with guilt for not doing more to raise awareness while others that were in NASA management still see nothing wrong with their decisions to clear the *Challenger* for launch on that cold January morning in 1986. I also appreciated that it didn't show the actual explosion until episode 3, it made the series flow better, at least from my perspective.

So to get back to the title subject at hand, in the closing moments of the final episode of the docu-series a series of blurbs closed out the series with some information following the return to flight of *Discovery* in 1988  about pertinent facts on the Morton one stating that ""*For the next 15 years, the space shuttle flew 86 successful mission.*"" and than transitions to ""*On February 1, 2003* Columbia *broke apart during re-entry.*"" ""*All seven crew members were lost.*"" and finally ""*An investigation revealed a similar failure to fix a well-documented issue.*""

This minor overview of the *Columbia* Disaster should be expanded into it's own docu-series to follow up on why the attitudes at NASA had not changed after the loss of seven people due to their own negligence and complaisance which led to seven more lives being lost. And of course going over in similar detail the issues with the foam insulation shedding off  the external tank just as they did with the O-Rings. That it had been documented just like the O-Ring problem, and because nothing happened the issue was, for lack of a better term, ignored until the ""unthinkable"" happened... again.",0,2332,397

"View your Netflix statistics!Hi!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm making a tool in my spare time and it's in a condition that everyone should try it.

It's a simple website where you can upload your netflix statistics and you get some beautiful data and a nice chart about your stats. (See pictures)

&amp;#x200B;

How to use it?

&amp;#x200B;

Navigate to your Netfix Viewing Activity (link below) and scroll to the bottom of the page and on the right side you will se a download all button.

After you downloaded it you have to upload it to Netflix Statistics (link below)

If you did everything correctly you have to see some statistics. (See pictures)

&amp;#x200B;

Save my statistics?

&amp;#x200B;

Yes you can, I made some payed features to keep up the site. You can save your uploaded statistics and compare them later. Example you can save it every month and look back how many time you spend watching Netflix in a month.

&amp;#x200B;

Future plans?

&amp;#x200B;

For technical peoples: the site currently runs on AWS. Its built with Node.js and EJS. AWS is quite expensive if you could support the site its a big help. Or you have a good idea you can contribute on GitHub (link below.)

My future plan is if I get some supporters I will make a ""Toplist"" where everyone can share there stats and compare them.

So does anyone know if netflix is ‚Äã‚Äãgoing to release this series in Poland in the future? Contrary to appearances, anime in Poland is quite popular, so it would not be so bad to make some better anime available to the Polish consumer. Btw, or is it just me who think it's a bit unfair to the consumer that we pay the same as the rest of the world and we don't get the same? I understand that Netflix gives us what sells in certain countries, but doesn't care about those who prefer something else.

"Tech question for My List orderFor some reason that I can't figure out My List has gone bananas. When I add a movie or show from any device (MacBook, iPhone, Roku) it is added to a random spot on My List.  2nd, 3rd, 11th.  Always towards the front but random none the less.  If I add multiple things in a row they will not stay in the order I added them. For example, if I add Narcos and then immediately add The Derry Girls, Narcos may be before or after The Derry Girls, and there may even be movies/shows between them.  If I go into My List on my desktop and attempt to manually move movies/shows in order, the page immediately refreshes and the position stays the same. The ""Move to top"" feature places movies at the end of my queue which is the only time they'll actually move - so essentially I can never move whatever is first in My List. I have 167 movies/shows in My List currently. My List is also set to manual order. 

Things I have already tried:

1. Deleting and reinstalling apps for each device
2. Wiping all data from each device, as well as my internet cookies/history
3. Setting My List order to ""Netflix Recommends"" and then back to manual
4. Deleting everything from My List and then re-adding it

I KNOW that this is completely trivial, but considering that I'm not leaving the house much and don't have much going on other than watching Netflix it is driving me ABSOLUTELY INSANE.

"So Cuties is now a thing, huh?I've heard it's a movie criticizing how over-sexualized things are in the west.

Maybe getting that point across with full grown adults would have fallen on deaf ears, and perhaps it would've been liked even.

Putting children in that role is I think purposefully made to disturb people and make them think.

Did they go too far with it? Probably. But I think that's the point.

I don't think its intention was to normalize pedophilia, although pedos probably enjoy the film (which is why films like this shouldn't be made, perhaps).

I think the intention was to ask ""how far can we go with making everything involve sex?""

I still wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",0,695,121

"Cuties versus Japenese Idol MusicHey. Stay safe out there in covid!

So there was a mega thread about cuties.

I watch and listen to Japanese Idol music. It's. It's what the movie should of been. It's young girls, 14-24 is bands. And it's all very sexy.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FWug-mUYts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FWug-mUYts)

So. I don't really think theres anything wrong with cuties as a whole but.... that trailer.

Okay let me start first by saying someone on Bannerlord made a cuties joke. I had no idea what it was. Then later I had netflix on and I saw cuties.

First thing I noticed was it's some muslim chick. Okay. Cool. I start watching the trailer to see what it is. Oh... okay... this young girl looks really.... attractive... wow! Those a tight pants.

The trailer makes all the sex look.... The trailer focus' on how hot the young girls are. And there fucking hot. Hahaha. Holy fuck it's so weird.

Like I don't have a problem saying those girls in cuties are sexy. You know. There's going to be young boys that would like to go out on cute little dates.

BUT WHY IS THE TRAILER FOCUSING ON THEIR ASSES!

Oh. Then I noticed its a French movie.

Doesn't France have a lot of muslims in it? Is the Director just attacking muslims?

And what is with making these young girls look so good.

I mean... The Japanese Idol music has tons of this pedo shit but it doesnt make me feel like a pedo. Because its about the music. And the fun. Not about just... omg... how tight the one girls pants are. And just all the twerking. Hahhahahahahahaahahaha.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zn5TdAmlMc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zn5TdAmlMc)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebShKgjBGKk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebShKgjBGKk)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNPHQ0yrkW8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNPHQ0yrkW8)

I just dont get Cuties. It's not about little girls exploring sexuality. It's about my sexuality as an older man for a little girl. I have not seen the movie. I mean. Why would I watch it? I'd only watch it because the girls in it have such tight asses. God I'm a pervert and that trailer was even to perverty for me.

So do any of you watch Wrestling? This guy Kenny Omega wrestled a 9 year old girl in a promotion called DDT wrestling. It's comedy wrestling that kind of explores sexuality. This was many years ago. But pedos are kind of just.... a common thing. Like Kenny Omega probably isnt a pedo but ummm he wrestled a 9 year old girl in a wrestling promotion that explores sexuality. So does kenny omega want to explore sexuality with a 9 year old girl?

Different topic but wrestling still. Sunny Kiss. Sunny Kiss is a homosexual or something. Whatever. But in the ring when Sunny Kiss gets hit he makes this orgasm sounds. Like ""OHHHHH"" or ""UHHHHH"" like a girl cumming. It's really dumb. And everyone cheers. And he does it in front of kids. Like.... hes making cumming sounds...

I dont get it.

I dont get any of it.

Young girls are sexy okay.

But cuties isnt about young girls being sexy. It's something else.

Cuties goes so far to make those young girls look hot. Why as a director or a producer of a show would you want to do that? If Im making a movie Im gonna make a movie of things I want to see.

It really feels like the people who made this movie just wanted to watch little girls twerk.

Id really like to hear your thoughts on this. Because I watch young girls dance all the time but they dont twerk. Is there a difference?

Oh. Netflix has some black lives matter thing. Im just gonna rant while Im here and say, that shit is so dumb. They aren't black lives, they are just lives.

What the fuck is going on in this world!?

I NEED SEASON 2 of FUCKING WITCHER!!!

Edit: I dont feel Cuties is about the story of sexual pressure on young ladies. I think its just about their asses. The movie does way to good of a job of having these very sexy young tight women do all this twerking and pole-like dancing. ITS FUCKING OBVIOUS ITS JUST TO WATCH. Like. You didnt have them practice all this dancing because you didnt think its hot. Holy fuck what... fuck... hahaahahaha

I should go watch this movie but honestly I think Id have a really hard time. The trailer was so much more about how the girls look sexy then about how they feel sexy. Like. Is the movie going to try to seduce me as an audience member?

edit2: It's rated like 17+ it's not even a movie for kids. Its a movie for adults. So what kind of adult is going to watch a movie about an 11 year old twerking?",0,4546,792

Netflix should allow you to create multiple lists or have at least a ""watched"" list where you can put all your watched shows, away from your list.

Netflix should add a feature to review a series/movie so you can at least read a review on the site instead of just having the % that is shown now.

Netflix should add a feature that allows you to exactly define the definition so you just ""lag"" for 5 seconds, or make it buffer while paused instead of watching in shitty 720p on a TV.

Netflix should prioritize in a way foreign shows in a way that they have subtitles in at least English instead of dubbing it in your local language.

Netflix should make it possible to follow (follow and accept) so you can see what your friends are watching and can watch it as well, or just see how far they are.",0,1004,188

"Monitor Yeets Itself After an HourSo for several weeks now I've been trying to binge-watch this series and if I watch Netflix for more than an hour, my monitor shuts off and the only way to get it to turn back on is to completely turn off the computer and turn it back on.   


My graphics card is AMD Radeon R9 380 Series (and I just checked it's up to date)  
I'm running the latest Windows 10  
My monitor is a small Vizio TV  
I do not have a screensaver set up on this computer.  
I have checked the cords, replaced them, and even attempted to replace the surge protector itself.

"UnorthodoxSo I‚Äôve finally watched it and had very high expectations since it was so well received but honestly ? I didn‚Äôt find it that good. There a kind of distance and a lack of true emotion in this mini series that I find quite contradictory with the actual theme. It‚Äôs supposed to be an extremely emotional story yet, nothing is made to actually make you empathize or actually feel the depth of the feelings involved. I found it really interesting but most of the time.. almost stern ? I tend to cry and empathize quite easily with emotional stories but this one left me askinf myself ¬´¬†is that it ?¬†¬ª. Idk it felt lackluster and not as good as I wanted it to be.

its like Joanna is often trying to talk and often gets shut down by Clea. It kind of Bothers me, because its a show that is trying to show how women can empoyer eachoter, but often youll notice that Clea is the Boss, its her way of the highway.

"Weird censorship of Adventure TimeI get Netflix here in Luxembourg and I recently watched the episode ‚ÄúTime Sandwich‚Äù where Jake makes his ultimate sandwich before Magic Man shows up to wreak havoc. 

The last ingredient of the sandwich is a strange one, he throws a lobster in a pot of boiling water and then captures its soul as it dies and puts the lobster soul on his sandwich. 

Except not here in Luxembourg. That part is cut from the scene, it skips from the bacon to the sandwich already assembled. (I watched it on YouTube to make sure it was actually supposed to be there.)

"The Devil All The Time (Spoilers)Woah. Fucking bone chilling.

Let me start off by saying that this movie (8.5/10 imho) has some phenomenal acting by a stellar cast including the likes of Bill Skarsg√•rd, Jason Clarke, Robert Pattinson, Sebastian Stan, Tom Holland, Riley Keough, Mia Wasikowska and many more. Seriously, hats off!

I went into this movie thinking nothing much other than some bad people doing some bad things and that would be it. Boy was I wrong.

The story never seems to let off the gas. Bad people doing bad things that result in even worse outcomes is seemingly the idea of the movie, but inbetween the bad deeds is a constantly heartbreaking story about a set of characters whose lives become increasingly intertwined as their paths continue to move forward. The way that the narrarator, who is the same man who wrote the book of which the movie is based, could seemingly calm your nerves inbetween each devilish act (there are plenty to go around) is nothing short of amazing.

I won't spoil the plot but I will give a fair warning. Some scenes in this movie include glimpses/flashes of absolutely brutal imagery. Including, but not limited to, &gt;!a dog seen hung on a wooden cross!&lt; and &gt;!a mans genitals being cut off!&lt; as well as &gt;!a woman bleeding out over the course of 30-60 seconds from a stab wound in her neck.!&lt; You've been warned.",0,1381,238
"The devil all the time.Wow. I was kind of blown away with this one. It's strange because the narrative is a little all of the place but all in all, it holds together pretty tightly. Tom Holland has a bright future ahead of him. And Robert Pattinson, although he doesnt have a lot of screen time, also delivers a great performance. I highly recommend this film to anyone who has Netflix and would love to discuss it with you guys here!",0,434,81

"The Social Dilemma: My ResponseSo I came across The Social Dilemma myself a couple of days ago, after browsing Netflix. I have always had an interest in the psychology of online, social media, our relationship with it etc. So I watched it.

The way that the information was broken down and explored was both mind blowing and scary. They talk about things I've always had concerns about but not enough to drive me away completely myself. I have talked about deleting my social media over the past couple of years a few times but never took the plunge.

Let me tell you, I finished that documentary and I deleted absolutely everything. Facebook, Twitter, Insta, everything. I felt so strongly by the time I'd finished, that I was involved in something much more profound than anybody gives credit for, that I didn't want a part in it any longer.

I'll be honest. The constant going on my phone to click on the FB app is a little astounding. It's autonomous and subconscious. I've realised that I was only going on out of habit, not even for a purpose. I wouldn't go on to see what my friends are posting, I would go on because my brain has been trained to just fill time with scrolling.

I wouldn't say I feel 100x better but I know I will. What I feel like at the moment is as though I'm stood outside a house with the curtains shut, my friends are all in there and I'm stood outside curious whats going on inside but not wanting to go in and see. I feel like I've lost all my friends but I know I haven't!? It's crazy. I've kept messenger so people can stay in touch but I've actually only heard from 2 people lol. I didn't announce I was leaving or say anything. I just wanted to leave. My own sister hasn't noticed yet so it just shows that people are actually interested or invested in you and what you share. You're just part of their feed of other endless posts and memes.

Social media isn't actually social at all.

So I'm interested to hear how you guys responded after watching. Its definitely opened my eyes to my behaviour and attitude towards it before. I realise that I actually have *loads* of spare time. I fill a lot of hours with just scrolling and checking things over and over. I know that in the long run it's gonna be so much better for me. The only thing that scares me is that I'm now outside of the norm so whatever does come out of this in the future, it's gonna be like fighting a losing battle because 80% of the world are still addicted. You're seen as odd if you don't have social media.

Anyway, let me know how you guys felt! I'm glad I've done it. I really am.",0,2592,487

"The Babysitter Killer Queen(Sorry for formatting, I am on mobile.)

So I just watched this movie today with my brother, and I was confused in a few ways. For one, when did Bee decide to be on Coles side? Like when she shows up at the end of the movie and tricks the other villains into dying she is just on Coles side. 

Second, how did his friend just betray him like that? I mean did she really want to be an influencer so bad that she would kill her best friend for it? 

Lastly, when did Cole have sex. It is elaborated in this movie that to be innocent means to be a virgin. I assume that he lost it in that basement with that other girl, but they made it seem like all they did was kiss.

The only thing even slightly out of the ordinary since Netflix worked yesterday is when I opened it today, music was playing in iTunes. I hit the pause button on my keyboard but it paused the Netflix preview that was auto-playing. I switched to iTunes, paused that, back to Chrome, clicked a show, got this error.

"Netflix Gripe:Not sure if this is the place to make this gripe, if there is a better place then let me know.  


I bought my first 4K TV in April.  I ordered the Premium Package as an upgrade immediately to check out the TV I just bought.  When I started watching though, the picture was horrible, to the point that even white text that measured 2 inches high on my 59"" screen (RU7100 Samsung) was distorted.    


I checked out Amazon Prime Video and the picture was gorgeous!  Found a show without any film grain to check the clarity and it looked better than anything I've ever seen up to that point.  


I called up Netflix Customer Service 3 times at least, I have recordings, but I think 4 times in all.  Due to a situation with my landlord and his leasing office I automatically record all calls, but sometimes one will not record for whatever reason.  I remember the one lady not really caring, but the other two seemed helpful.  I told them Prime Video looked spectacular.  I told them that it's a new TV so maybe that's it.  I told them I have the TV plugged directly into the modem, that I have a 400mb package, and all of that.  They went through their routine with me, which wasn't long at all but didn't seem to need to be long given the limited menu Netflix has.  They had me do the GET HELP and check my connection option off the menu.  They couldn't fix the problem, all 3 of them.    


Two of these customer service reps told me to get with my cable provider and have them check the line.  I did.  The first one came out and since our entire neighborhood was out as far as internet goes, he couldn't check the line so he had me reschedule.  I recorded this as well!  Suddenlink is the ISP.  The second guy came out a week or two later and found no issues at all.  Whole thing cost me 2x $60 (per visit) even though the first visit was fruitless due to my ISP being out in the neighborhood.    


I get a new 4K TV, a Sony X900H (getting ready for the release of the PS5) and I have the same problem with Netflix, though gorgeous picture for Prime Video.  I call Netflix, lady fixes everything by sending me an email link to my Netflix Profile.  I click on a couple of dispositions and change my connection from LOW to HIGH and things are perfect now.  She can't issue a $30 credit for an issue the other 3-4 reps couldn't fix (could, but didn't), and for them giving me advice that cost me $120 in Cable Guy visits.  


Supervisor hears my story, says he ""completely understands,"" but that they do not give credits for issues like mine.  They don't issue credits for bad experiences with their customer service reps that cost their customers money ($120).  I ask him to validate what he said after he knows I'm recording the call and he will not say again that he understands.  Just keeps repeating that they only give credits for up to 3 months of non-use if you cancel and within the first 7 days of service if you cancel.  He gives me an address to write a letter to Netflix Corporate.  He said his name is Keri, spelled it out for me.  


Have any of you all had good luck with mailing Netflix Corporate.  Is there a better sub to post this story to?  


Is Netflix Customer Service notoriously bad like this?  Google says it is but Google will say whatever you want it to.  If I am the only person here that has had a bad experience then I'll just drop it here and now.  My experience though, costing me money I don't have, makes me want to chase this in hopes the problem doesn't affect anyone else.

"Video keeps glitching out during Schitt‚Äôs CreekSo for the last week I‚Äôve been binging SC and every episode within the last 1:30-1:35 will cut out for a second before going back to normal. But now, starting with episode 7 of season 4, at that same time marker the video will cut out completely while the audio continues on. A quick close/re-opening of the app clears it up (until the next episode), so I guess I‚Äôm just curious if anyone else has had this issue with Schitt‚Äôs Creek? Or is there any other show you might have had a similar issue with? I updated the app this morning but the issue hasn‚Äôt cleared up, so I suppose I‚Äôm trying to figure out if this is an issue with this show or maybe my account has some weird little glitch only I‚Äôm experiencing?",0,757,141
"No Cell phone cannot sign upHi, we live in the boonies and no cell coverage. Netflix wants a cell phone number to complete the sign up and will not go past it.

"Random titles appear unavailable on one of my devices but are playable on others, reappear randomly after hours or days [ALL]So this has happened to me several times now where I log into Netflix trying to start up some show where I left off a day or two prior and it won't appear in my recently watched. When I search for the title it will show up as unavailable in the ""explore titles related to"" list. Sometimes if I wait long enough and reload the page it will become available again, other times I have to switch browsers or devices to watch certain titles, even though all of these devices are in the same room on the same internet in the same country. I have also had titles disappear on different devices so it is not a hardware-specific problem. Has anyone encountered anything like this before?",0,803,146
"Tips for those who think there's nothing to watch.A common thing I read in this sub and hear in real life is people asking what to watch because they feel like they've watched everything. I just want to give some tips to help people out. I'm going to start on the home page and get more detailed. If you follow these tips and continuously add stuff to your My List, you should be able to build out your list and always have *something* queued up to watch going forward.

**Home Page**

1. Check the top 10.
2. Check what's trending.
3. Check the random categories they put together for you.

Seems obvious but I just wanted to throw that out there.

**Sections**

1. Check the top 10 in TV Shows. This is different from the top 10 on the home page.
2. Check the top 10 in Movies. This is different from the top 10 on the home page.
3. Check the Latest/Coming Soon sections. Watch trailers, set reminders for upcoming shows, and add stuff to your list that looks even a little interesting. Reminders send you a notification and add programs to your My List with they release.
4. Check the trending for each TV/Movie section (Comedy, Horror, etc.). This is different from the home page and the top level TV/Movie trending lists.

**Within a Show/Movie**

1. If something even looks even *remotely* interesting to you, watch a trailer. If you're still even *a little* interested add it to your My List. The thumbnails for shows and movies change often. Something that catches your eye one day might get overlooked later.
2. Check the more like this section within shows and movies you like.
3. Rate things you've watched! I normally thumbs up things I like, but I rarely thumbs down things I don't like unless I really didn't like it because I want to get recommended as wide a range of programs as possible.

**Use Descriptive Searches**

You can describe what you want to see in search. For example if I type ""african comedy"" I get a bunch of stuff I've never seen before because I'm not african and I don't typically watch african programming. If I type ""car action"" I get a bunch of results that have cars in the thumbnail or have a lot of car scenes (Burn Out, Wheelman, Lost Bullet, etc.). I even typed in ""Sad Dog"" and get 3 Dog programs with the Heartfelt tag on them. Experiment. I think it works best with 2-3 words max, but that's just my experience.

**Use Your List**

If you go through all sections, coming soon, watch trailers, and add stuff to your list that looks interesting your My List should start to fill up. My list got ridiculously large and it took me a while to realize that your list follows you through the genre categories. When you got to Movies, your list will be there but only with movies. If you go to the Horror section of TV Shows your list will be there but only with Horror TV Shows.

**Outside of Netflix**

Typically, once Netflix releases a trailer of a show/movie on youtube you can search for it in the app and add it to your My List. I do this a lot so I don't forget new stuff between when it's announced and when it's released.

I hope this is helpful. This might all be common sense to most of you but most people I know don't use the the My List feature and rarely navigate off the home page.

**TL;DR - Get off the front page and explore. Check the genre sections, set reminders and add stuff to your list that looks interesting. Use descriptive searches to find specific categories of programming.  Once a trailer for a show is released on youtube you can usually add it to your list on netflix the same day.**",0,3557,654

"The Idh√∫n Chronicles: The kind of animated production we need now, but that it's difficult to support at the momentLast  week, on Sept 10, Netflix released its first anime-styled animated  series from Spain called The Idhun Chronices, based on the young-adult  book trilogy Memorias de Idhun, by Laura Gallego, and created by studio  Zeppelin TV, a studio that worked previously on another anime-styled  production called Virtual Hero, based on a comic book series of the same  name by popular Spanish youtuber [ElRubiusOMG](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXazgXDIYyWH-yXLAkcrFxw).

It  might not be a big milestone for Spain, as they've produced animated  content for some time now, but it's kind of a milestone in the sense  that, on the United Stated, we've had to deal with live-action movie  franchises based on young adult novels and comics because live-action is  more popular, instead of turning these big YA novels into animated  series when they have potential for that. So seeing a hispano-american  country step up and do what should've been done in the US a long time  ago. And the production team tried to make the most out of this book  adaptation. And also I think it's a milestone because it's like the 2nd  Netflix animated production that comes from a country with not many  resources to produce animation (the first one being [Legend Quest, or Las Leyendas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_Quest_(2017_TV_series)),  from Mexico). Productions like this come from countries that want to  showcase their talent to the world and demonstrate that even if they  live on a 3rd-world country, they can try big things.

But  being honest, there are reasons that limit the appeal of the series,  and these reasons are also why it's difficult to support this series at  the moment:

1. Back  in August when the trailers for the series where first revealed to the  public, the most notably aspect, and the one that drew the most  criticism, was the Spanish voice acting, which sounded amateur because  its main cast is mostly composed of a couple of live-action actors from  Netflix hit series like √âlite and Las Chicas Del Cable, to portray some  of the characters. Much like in some US animated productions, they  committed to the awful practice of casting people inexperienced with  voice acting as a way to boost the popularity of the series, thinking  that the series wouldn't get any attention otherwise. Worse yet, they  did so without consulting the author, who reported that there was a cast  of experienced voice actors already selected for the cast in 2018, but  Netflix changed the cast for the main characters without her consent,  and for the aforementioned reasons. As much as we hate this practice for  animated productions, the Netflix executives that did the practice were  painfully right on one hand. I was tracking the series on Reddit, 4chan  and some forums to see if people on the internet were willing to  discuss the series, and there's barely any online forums willing to  discuss the series. It's almost as if nobody knew about this series, or  as if it was too niche of a product. And if that's with live-action  actors who are inexperienced at voice acting, the series would be  non-existent even while having experienced but lesser known voice  actors, and it's a big shame.
2. The  other factor that plays against it it's that the first season adapted  the first half of the 1st book in the Trilogy (The Resistance) in 5  episodes, and just as in the series, this is the most boring and  info-dumpy part of the book. As far as I've been told, the book hits its  stride later on, but even while having author Laura Gallego as one of  the screenwriters, the series doesn't have much in the way of exciting  and pulse-pounding developments.
3. Also,  in these modern times we're living in, new TV viewers are less willing  to wait for a show to get good later on. They want their shows to be  successful from the very first episode and the very first season, as  this is the point that determines if a series will be a big and popular  success, and if it doesn't succeed here, it's not gonna be popular later  on even with good seasons 2 or 3. So far the series has mixed reviews,  sometimes highlighting the effort put in at least making a convincing  art-style despite the limitations, but criticizing the shallowness of  the characters and limitations of worldbuilding and animation, and the  for the most part amateur voice acting.

I  admit I like the artstyle even if it looks limited, and you need to  check the end credits, which look beautiful. But the series is not an  exciting watch at the moment. I'd like to support the series, but it was  difficult for me to choose to watch the series due to these aspects I  mentioned, and also because I don't want to be the only person  interested on watching the series while everybody else either forgets it  exists, or think the series is not worth watching and drops it on  episode one. I'd like this series to have more than 2 seasons, and it  needs a lot of support for that, but Netflix is mostly relying on  customer's views to support the series. Otherwise, it will be left in  the dirt and it will not encourage lesser-powerful countries to try new  animation productions. So make of that what you can.",0,5308,897

In Sex Education, it made sense because the character was openly gay from the beginning and his character made sense in the over-all plot. His boyfriend and his frenemy also made sense in the over-all context of the story and those individual characters.

"An honest discussion on the current netflix controversy To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Cuties. The sexuality is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of feminism and intersectionality most of the scenes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Amy's wholesome outlook, which is deftly woven into her characterization- her personal philosophy draws heavily from Sandra Harding's literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these scenes, to realise that they're not just uplifting- they say something deep about FEMINISM. As a consequence people who dislike Cuties truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the independence in Amy's existential dance move ""Lift up my shirt and show you my chest,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Sandra Harding's epic Objectivity and Diversity. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Ma√Ømouna Doucour√©'s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them

"The Social Dilemma - a Netflix show that can really help generate consensus and not division
I just watched this and I was grateful that it was informative but also pretty politically neutral which is rare. I was watching it thinking all sides of the political spectrum could probably nod along - how rare is that! It‚Äôs true that a lot of what is on this may not be new to the well informed. It is also slightly hyperbolic in parts (ironically employing some of the the very emotive presentation that it rails against). But regardless, overall it was a much needed consolidation of things we all probably new or suspected. I predict that this will be a big hit and probably quite influential.

Am I missing some culture context here ? Is there like this bug divide between Koreans on if the correct way to cook instant noodles is to drain the water or not and both think theirs is the best way? If all ways drained it when making rom dom using both noodles because that's what Maangchi tells us too.

"I LOVE the new auto preview feature when on a title‚Äôs pageSo my Netflix just started showing auto previews when clicking into the page of a title. I love this, even though I pretty much hate the auto previews on the main pages. 

When I click into a specific title it means I‚Äôm interested in it so the previews is more welcome.  Also, with the preview it is WAY easier judge if I want to see something and honestly as short of a time as I‚Äôve had the title auto previews, it‚Äôs made me interested and wanting to watch more than I would have otherwise because I can see a snippet of it instead if only reading a vague preview. 

I know the title page already had preview trailers on some titles, but for me they were on a second page you had to click to and then click in the trailer to play, so much less intuitive. And the worst thing was, many things didn‚Äôt have any trailers and those were often the ones I was really on the fence about.

Most of their movies  and shows are formulaic, and give away their endings or arcs well in  advance. And I'm gonna be honest, this show does it too.

However,  I'm on season 2 episode 5 of Good Witch (which I think also has a movie  series) and am showing no signs of slowing down.

It's just so wholesome, and even though it sticks to the Hallmark formula it does it really well.

I  don't typically watch a lot of shows on any platform that aren't anime,  historical, fantasy, or a combination thereof. However I was laying  down last night and wanted to take a break from marathoning The Crown  and just randomly picked this show and I've really enjoyed it.

The only time it's not absolute shit is when I am using apple tv but it's in my brothers room and obviously I can't use it whenever I want. Netflix shows are clear but everything else is terrible. I'm guessing this is some DRM issue?

I'm not paying for a subscription that's quite literally worse than a user uploading a movie to youtube. Does anyone know a fix? There use to be an extension that gets 1080p but it only works on netflix shows so I guess they know about it and patched it.

"Cuties Discussion MegathreadHello all.

The last post didn't go very well, with a lot of abuse being thrown around, but we're here to try again.

You are free to discuss Cuties in this thread, and this thread only.  This thread will be heavily moderated and here are the groundrules:  


1. No one cares about your politics. You bring that up, you're gone.  
2. Any direct accusation of pedophilia, you're gone. - To clarify, Rule 2 of this post is meant to shield actual users of the site from being accused of being pedophiles.  Example: ""I watched the movie and don't understand what the issue is"" ""OMG YOU'RE A PEDO!""  If you want to rail against Netflix or the filmmakers, have at it.  But, you won't be able to call people on this site pedos.  
3. Spew any unsubstantiated conspiracies, fringe talking point... you're way gone.

**This sub is not run or monitored by Netflix and we will not be dealing with your rage toward them here.**  

If you have issues with them, feel free to contact them via Twitter, Facebook, Customer Service... whatever. But it won't happen in this subreddit. If this thread turns into a shitflinging fight, it'll be pulled down and we'll resume with the permanent banning.

Edit: For those of you that have cried about not being able to discuss the movie... Maybe you should spend time discussing the movie instead of talking about how you can't discuss your feelings in a thread dedicated to discussing your feelings/thoughts, eh?",0,1466,252

"""Cuties"" Discussion MegathreadHello, it looks like a ton of the posts and comments were getting automatically moved to the moderation queue due to the number of reports they were getting. This goes for any subject. 

Also, the sub was getting brigaded, and people were getting verbally abusive, so I'm assuming that is why other mods were banning a lot of the comments? That's what the notes on them and the links to their comments show.

I haven't seen this particular movie, but when I checked IMDB for the content guide, some of the descriptions were across the line for me personally, and that's not something I would normally view in a non-documentary format.  Netflix did admit they bungled the promotion, which I did see, and that also was over the line for me. I'm not a big believer in censorship, but knowing how much child abuse and trafficking is going on, it's hard to feel impartial solely in the name of ""art."" We don't have any contact with Netflix or duty to defend them, so I think a discussion is warranted. 

I know people on here are heated and have opinions, try and keep it somewhat civil as abusive comments do get reports from others, which leads to removal, etc. I'm going out of town, so I most likely won't get to read any of the responses for several days. Other mods may feel differently, or be quicker to ban people who publicly call us ""pedophile pieces of shit,"" so we'll see how this goes?",0,1423,255

"Interesting thing about successful showsIn the first seasons all is fine, the actors/actresses are acting normally, everything is awesome.

When the show hits a certain success point, you can actually tell by the drop of the quality, or better yet the kind of their acting.

The actors are now acting, like...I don't know exactly how to name it....

There's a certain extra layer in their expressions,in the tone of their voice that is off putting.

Don't know if it's arrogance, or just  ""I'm much more happy than before we get nation or even world famous"" but it literally affects their acting and you can actually see it in their facial expressions, hear it in their voices, while acting.

By the time the last season comes, they remind  you more of the actor/actress when they are giving an interviews than the actor/actress that made you love the show in the first seasons.",0,878,151

"Hollywood Satire/ParodyI recently watched Hollywood on Netflix and I just can't get the show out of my head. Not that it was particularly fantastic, but the way that everything went seemed so... wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

The main conflict of the show, racism/homophobia, seemed so unreal. The racism and homophobia felt almost nonexistent compared to the reality of that time period. It was an undertone that I felt throughout the entire show, but especially hit me when the news said that ""Protests almost disappeared as people flocked to the theaters."" I'm sorry, but there is absolutely no way that such a racially progressive film would have protests just ""fade away.""

&amp;#x200B;

 When I first watched it, the whole thing felt extremely tone-deaf. It felt like they just put layers of sugar on history. Not to mention the fact that every minority character got a massive redemption arc and EVERYBODY won. As if the film just cured racism, homophobia, and exploitation in the film industry.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been thinking about it a lot, and settled on a few theories: the show was trying to show what *could* happen if Hollywood cared about people instead of money, or, more likely, the show is a parody of the film industry as a whole. 

&amp;#x200B;

The title of the last episode, ""A Hollywood Ending,"" is what made me think that this show was kind of satire. In that episode, the first black woman, asian woman, and gay man win an oscar, the first homosexual love film is produced, the rapist rights his wrongs, the greedy executive becomes socially progressive, and the closeted executive comes out.

&amp;#x200B;

In the actual 40s that would be honestly impossible. I mean, the KKK was still lynching people in that time period. But this isn't a realistic ending. This is ""A Hollywood Ending."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Is it possible that the show is trying to make some kind of meta-commentary on how Hollywood downplays the harsh realities of racism and homophobia to make more palatable films?

&amp;#x200B;

It is also very possible that I'm reading too much into this",0,2077,346

Now on one of the Jackass films(3.5), it has happened again (with Subtitles off). That font and style is wierdly part of the films identity and its kinda is offputting.   It was fine before, atleast add an option to change it. I honestly don't see the point in the change.",0,692,121

It is only the Netflix app that is effected.

* Uninstalling and reinstalling the app, which works, but then the issue comes back when I turn off the TV and back on again.
* Updating the firmware on the TV.
* Changing the DNS server information.
* Resetting the TV to default settings.

"Ozark S3E6 horrible quality on one device, ok on othersI can't figure out what is happening here, but  Ozark S3E6 has horrible image quality on just one of my Apple TV 4k's (wireless) but not others. This whole season seems to be more grainy but that's not what I'm talking about. What I'm seeing is low resolution quality blockiness, worse than SD quality. 

The same episode on my iPad on the same Wifi and another Apple TV 4k (wired) all look fine. I tried deleting and reinstalling the Netflix app to clear any local caches that might exist and it didn't help. My network connection is fine and measures over 60mbps. Other streaming apps like Prime and ATV+ all look fine.

The only other difference is that the Apple TV with the poor quality is on the latest tvOS beta. I noticed I was an update behind but installing it made no difference. I also noticed going back to S3E5 also has the quality problem - and I just watched that a couple days ago on the same Apple TV with the tvOS beta without issues, so I'm not convinced it's related.",0,1043,192

"Hoops. Terrible ratings, I love this show tho..Let me preface this by saying im hugely into adult animation. I've subbed to Netflix and Hulu since either was created. I always considered Hulu mandatory because of Fox adult animation. Family Guy, Bob's Burgers, Futurama, the list goes on of amazing Fox-created adult animation programs.

I took notice of Netflix when F is for Family and Big Mouth came along. My brother got me into Paradise PD too, I tried Bojack, just haven't had the attention, but I hear its great. I don't even pay attention to Hulu or Fox anymore. I was big into Adult Swim, South Park, I love adult animation and Netflix finally satisfies that itch.

I saw Hoops was coming out, got super excited, it came out when I didn't have time to watch, so I put it on the back burner. I had time off, started it, I loved it! I looked it up, expecting fandom like Big Mouth or FIFF, nope, none. it has a floppy donkey dick of *15%* on Rotten Tomatoes.

prime video has a good option of black/yellow instead of white which solves both the issues,burn-in is prone to occur on bright images

"New and innovative service from Netflix [US][Awesome: Netflix Will Now Just Pump Septic Waste Straight Into Your Living Room](https://babylonbee.com/img/articles/article-6966-2.jpg)

&gt; Streaming giant Netflix has announced a new and innovative service that will literally just pump thousands of gallons of septic waste right into your living room. For the low price of $8.99 per month, you can watch as a sewage truck backs up to your house and pipes 2,000 gallons of brown sludge through the wall until you are neck-deep in toxic waste.
&gt; 
&gt; ""The industry is evolving, and we're evolving with it,"" said Reed Hastings, co-CEO and chairman of Netflix. ""We started to realize we were paying people millions of dollars to produce expensive septic waste for the family to enjoy and consume unquestionably. As it turns out, you can get the putrid sludge straight from an underground tank for free! Who would've guessed! This will cut billions of dollars from our expenses and enable us to deliver more sewage to your home than ever before!"" 
&gt; 
&gt; The CEO also said not to read too much into the new service: ""It's not a metaphor or anything. It's just raw, pure, untreated sewage.""
&gt; 
&gt; Enthusiastic Netflix customers have jumped on this new service and are gleefully rolling in their slime-coated living rooms. ""I don't like all the waste,"" said one excited parent. ""But sometimes, it doesn't smell all that bad. Definitely worth the $8.99 per month!"" 
&gt; 
&gt; Starting next year, Netflix will also offer a more premium service that allows you to have your septic waste delivered by a real-life drag queen.

"Cuties's ending is abrupt and kinda disappointing (spoilers)The crew prepared months for this dancing tournament, and Amy pushed the 4th girl into the river so she could take her spot.

Then after dancing on the stage, Amy suddenly had a change of heart and left. How could she do that? That not only didn't make sense, but also betrayed her friends' trust, especially the girl with the glasses who defended her all the time. They could have won the competition. Amy ruined it. It was so selfish. 

At the end, it's seen she joined the neighborhood's children play. It's so lame. The movie is supposed to be about rebellion, to be about going against the enforced cultural norm, to be about personal exploration and liberation. That was a set back. And also it was unbelieable and unrealistic, because a girl thirsting for freedom and breaking the chain from the senseless ""traditions"" wouldn't just all of sudden have a change of heart and go back into boring, ""traditional"" life style again.",0,993,170

"Netflix, please, you can't just rely on Witcher.What happened to Netflix's apparent one-time goal of producing nerd pleasing sci-fi with bite? This gripe goes back to them losing The Exapanse to Amazon, becasue the show simply has not been replaced, and they are now axing more sci-fi with potential to be more than shite tween-drama. I just finished watching Altered Carbon season 2, yes it was hard work. I am not surprised they have canceled season 3. Season 2 was a pale shadow of season 1. 

Now the show is canceled I feel that the show creators were way to  cowardly with season 2..it went out with a whimper. No characters with  venom, no sex, no cynicism, lots of violence to try make up for it...it does not - Call of duty is full of violence too, and popular with kids for a reason. The  entire season is plagued by a feeling of what I can only describe as woke censorship and a lack of spine. And boy did season 2 miss James Purefoy's acting and delivery. Never underestimate what having an actor who has actual stage experience can do to drag an entire show up to standard.

Terrible. What a waste  of potential. I dont think netflix have many other interesting IPs (If I'm ignornat of some shows they are doing/have al;ready made, please enlighten me)...

Was Ray's wife infertile? Was Lisa infertile? I'm not sure if the backstory on the adoption was ever even mentioned. It just was the premise of the show and wasn't really explained. Idk, just thinking about it more so on Lisa's part because she's younger than Ray, so she was in her late teens, early 20's when she adopted Tia. Realistically, someone that young wouldn't just adopt unless infertility was a problem. Maybe there they said the reason and i just missed it lol.

""We focus on managers‚Äô judgment through the 'keeper test' for each of their people: if one of the members of the team was thinking of leaving for another firm, would the manager try hard to keep them from leaving?

"""Away"" is one of the worst sci-fi shows in a long time - and it's a damn shamei was really looking forward to the show ""Away"" with Hillary Swank as the commander of the first manned mission to mars. I used to work for ESA (european space agency) in the past and know a few things about how the space industry and space missions work - so i was hoping for a fresh and realistic show about humand exploration of space. But the show turned out to be a huge disappointment. Let me list a few things about ""Away"" that bother me:

&amp;#x200B;

1. The crew: Nobody on this ship has any right to be in space at all. they are all self-absorbed, petty, backstabbing mavericks - not team players, who would put the mission above all else. there is zero chance that anyone acting like the people in this show would be put anywhere near a mars mission. we have a cosmonaut hiding his failing eyesight (like that wouldn't be caught in an exam and be immediate grounds for disqualification), a crew member suffering ""space madness"" and sleep walking on the ship (that's ""Armageddon"" level of stupid). most members spend a significant time chatting with their relatives at home - and getting entangled in their BS.  Missions are just not run like that.
2. Ship design: The mars rocket in this show has to be the worst designed ship in the history of space travel.  Start with the solar panels: it needs all three panels to keep the crew alive??? What if a panel gets damaged on the way to mars... on a real mission it would go like this: ""3 panels are great, but we only really need two, and we can manage with one, and even if that loses 75% power we will be fine."" but lets say they DO need all three panels. then the three panels would provide enough power for the ship all the way out to mars. a ship close to earth would get more than twice the energy from its solar panels - so having a deployment failure of one panel would give them easily a few months to figure out a fix. there would be absolutely no reason for a pointless suicide maneuver to get the panel into place. then there is their water reclamation system: they have one main system, and a backup that isn't a backup at all because it doesn't provide enough water for the crew. i cant even...... why have a backup at all then???
3. wasted space: whoever designed this ship has never looked at an image of the ISS interior. on a manned mission to mars you would fill every inch of wall, floor and ceiling with storage, scientific equipment and computer consoles. you would maybe get ONE larger section to hang out in. but separate crew quarters would definitely be impossible and completely unnecessary. those are just an incredible waste of space and weight. just imagine the amount of additional scientific equipment you could bring with you for the weight of one of those crew quarters. astronauts themselves would probably rip out all that stupid feel good comfy furniture and replace it with more equipment themselves! they are not on this flight to have a relaxed ride to mars. on the other hand: the crew in this show would actually better be suited for a Caribbean cruise ship, so that might explain their lavish accommodation.
4. water as radiation shielding: so they are using water inside the hull as radiation shielding. this is a really bad idea. on a spaceship weight is your number one concern. pumping many many tons of water into your ship to shield the crew from radiation would make a trip to mars impossible. water isn't even that good of a radiation shield by weight - you would use thin high density material like lead foil as shielding. i also don't understand why they basically removed radiation as a plot device by shielding the whole spaceship. radiation management could have been a big part of the show's plot - making for a more realistic and ""dangerous"" setting. i'm pretty sure they didn't have any science consultant at hand when writing in the whole water thing in the script.
5. the earth drama: ok, that's the most annoying part of the show. i couldn't care less about the drama on earth. you can for example skip episode 5 entirely - there is nothing happening of note. at all. except for their communication changing from real-time HD video chat to voice mail only with HUGE time delays. which brings me to....
6. communication: many weeks into their journey they still have no time delay in their communication at all. even on the moon you would have more than 2 seconds between you saying something and hearing their response. not on this show - they seem to have instant faster than light communication figured out! again - i don't understand that from a writer's perspective. the growing time delay could have been used as a perfect device to show the increasing distance to earth... also, it is pointed out that com delay would be growing to ""hours"" later in their journey. no - the maximum distance between earth and mars is less than 0.4 light hours. time for a signal round trip is still less than an hour then. but during the journey to mars trajectories would keep the ship much closer to earth (probably within 20 minutes). this is because you launch the ship in the same direction the earth is orbiting the sun and arriving at mars on its close approach to the earth orbit - that's pretty much the only viable orbit.
7. No science: astronauts don't seem to perform any experiments at all during their journey. a mission to mars would be filled with scientific experiments and observations the crew would have to perform. not just to keep them busy, also because it's the first time humans are leaving the earth-moon-system.
8. a few details: their space suits' reflective visors are NOT reflective, just slightly tinted. food is grown in the zero g section of the spaceship (would hamper growth a lot). no fitness training on the ship. etc etc etc

those are just a few things wrong with the show. feel free to add more - because there is plenty of BS going around.",0,5968,1076

"Save yourself 90 minutes and don't watch Freaks - You're One of UsSo I just suffered through this trainwreck of a movie and it was an incoherent mess. There was no character growth, everyone was petulant and moody, it felt like a first draft script a teenager might come up with and then just ran with it.

You could drive a semi through the plot holes in this movie. In what should have been the climax of the movie the protagonists simply abandon their quest. They just decide not to do the thing they said they were going to do and leave the scene. It's so infuriatingly awful.

Did I mention no character is likable? Everyone is so whiny and stupid you just really can't care if anyone succeeds. But don't worry because there won't be any character growth. Nobody will complete their arch. Everyone's motivations are only consistent to move the characters to the next scene and then it's tabula rasa, their motivations are wiped clean and they won't have learned anything or grown a second dimension.

"I just realized something about Lost in Space seriesFirst of all I'm an adult.

Now.

I like Lost in Space series and I can't wait for the next season.

But besides  enjoying the show there was another reason I felt that warm feeling watching it, 

never bother to put my finger on it, never consciously knew I had it.

Until I realized by a request from the post of another redditor who was looking for family friendly,

that it's probably the only 100% Family friendly show, made in the recent years,  that is made for adults.

I would like to see more shows like that.

We usually dismiss the existence cussing and sex references, and say that it doesn't matter, part of life,

but without them you really get a new sense, a new atmosphere while watching something.",0,768,138
"Can someone help me understand something about Away?Let me preface this by saying, I am halfway through the show and quite enjoying it, and I will finish it. That being said:

Why is going to mars so important for Emma and Matt that they put their daughter through this immense, 3 year long stress that comes with it? She is risking her life and thereby risking her daughter losing her mother basically forcing Lex live 3 years not knowing if her mother will ever come back from the mission with a 50% survival estimation. And Matt supports that decision. Why must it be Emma going to Mars. Without her they would have found another person to do the job. I just don't understand why she has to go. She's putting her life and thereby the mental well-being of her daughter on the line, for what? The glory of being one of the first people on mars? It seems a bit egoistical to me. It just doesn't seem worth it to risk all of that just to go to Mars.

If we take Interstellar for example, the reason Cooper needs to go is because it's either staying with his daughter or saving humanity, basically (if we accept the fact that they couldn't find anyone else to do his job, which makes enough sense in a world where NASA has been basically shut down). That's a really hard decision but I can understand and admire that he chose humanity over staying with his daughter. But in Away the choice doesn't seem so hard. No one would care if it's Emma or someone else leading the mission, they'll go to mars anyway. So it's a completely personal choice for her to go and she does it simply because she wants to achieve her dream, when there is something way more important on the line, on Earth.

Can someone help me understand?",0,1717,318

"Cost Of ExtractionHey all

I hope someone reads this who has watched Extraction and has wanted the answer to the only question in the movie that matters. I have rewatched it several times and, yes, obviously Tyler survives and I think they did a very good job of ending it as they thought that if the movie doesnt warrant a sequel at least it would have a top notch 'Nolan-esque' ending......however, that is not the most important question in the movie. The most important question is that in the beginning, Sanju states that Tyler would do it but due to the circumstances surrounding Mahajan Sr, they would not be able to afford him .........the most important question that ties together the entire plot line is .....what is Tyler's price. 

Does he work exclusively for Nik, or does he take international contracts.....as he admitted to doing 'assassinations' and he seems like the kind of guy that can be subtle if he wants. 

I mean - I think there is an entirely different, Bond, side to Tyler that the next movie should explore. His motivations for taking high risk jobs would throw him into the upper echelon of top tier jobs because he doesnt care about the outcome. 

Sanju thinks of Tyler immediately, so does that mean that Tyler is a well known mercenary? How come he doesnt have offers just rolling in ....?

Nik says they hit the jackpot .......they have their price and obviously the warrant for the job has to be higher ......

.......what is Tyler's personal price and what did they offer Nik to make her take the job .....as she seems quite high profile. 

Thanks .......!",0,1592,279

It was at a local food festival and the two guys said they were creating a kids show about eating healthy and that it would probably be released in February 2020. That's all the information I got. Obviously it has been a bit since then. I've searched for shows in that category a few times since then and found nothing. I didn't get either of the guys' emails, the Netflix support chat isn't allowed to release that information, and I didn't get any email back when I gave them mine for the release form.

I enjoy autoplaying trailers as I can just flip left or right and see what it's about (I have a fast internet so I don't know if people have an issue with loading or just hate it) but what I do miss about Netflix, is many years ago it allowed you to not only rate the shows (proper rating, not a thumbs up or down) which worked quite well with the algorithm but the site allowed you to pick all the genre's you like and dislike and order the accordingly. It allowed you to pick your favourite shows so it would find more like it, while allowing you to ignore stuff you don't like. 

There was much less on netflix at the time, but it really did a good job or recommending stuff to you if you spent the time to fill out the list (I mean, it was SERIOUSLY long).

"Low bitrate on random movies [DK]Hi there,
I live in EU and I know that Netflix has been ordered to lower the bandwidth usage. But the lower bandwidth usage only affects some movies and series. I have several examples of movies and tv shows playing in the highest possible resolution but also I have the opposite example of movies playing only at 960*540 even though it's newly added movies (from last week), say The Joker and Doctor Sleep.

What's going on? I don't get it. I've tried several things but this inconsistency bothers me.

"‚ÄòI‚Äôm Thinking Of Ending Things‚Äô was a colossal disappointment.Spoilers ahead, of course.

Man, as a reader of the book and a general fan of Kaufman I had high expectations for this movie. It starts off promising and many of the scenes in the house were quite interesting with stellar performances from most of the cast (though not really Jake‚Äôs actor funnily enough?) but it just gets worse and worse as you try to find answers to the mysteries laid out by the film. Not only is the ending entirely different from the books, it comes off to the viewer as an incoherent mess devoid of any clear direction. I truly feel bad for anyone viewing this narrative for the first time because I would have had absolutely 0 idea what the fuck was even happening. 

Kaufman seems to get more distracted by his surrealist stylisation of the the story rather than actually furthering the plot in a logical or even entertaining fashion. This leads to some cool moments but IMHO he misses the nuance and some core ideas of the text. Most notably, I was particularly confused by the characterisation of Jake. He is completely different in the text both in appearance and personality. Though still strange and perhaps awkward in ways, he appears more charming and the girlfriend has more of a dilemma trying to decide if Jake is actually bad or not whereas in the film it seems that the conversations they have mostly consist of repeated questions and phrases. Instead of fleshing out Jake and hinting at his own insecurities he just comes across as a jumpy, paranoid weirdo that so painfully clearly has something wrong with him from the get go - robbing the viewer of so much of the mystery and tension surrounding him.

Would love to discuss this stuff and see if you guys agree with some of my opinions!",0,1789,316

"What do y'all think of Im Thinking of Ending Things?I'm not one to comment my theories about movies but this one is a must. I just finished the movie and I've watched a couple theory videos to confirm and/or deny my thoughts. Overall, the movie was extremely interesting and I loved unpacking it. I don't think 'split personalities' is a great way of explaining it, though. I could be wrong (I didn't read the book), but my interpretation of it was that Lucy was the idea of 'the one' and 'a one' in Jakes life. Her body was just a surrogate for the women in Jake's romantic life. The janitor is Jake and the movie is Jake recalling his life, decisions, and personal judgements. Yes some parts were a bore, but I think each little detail mentioned had away of coming around and reminding us, subconsciously, that in movies, everything is there for a reason. The mind is often times not a chronological story. Some times you think of random times in your life that don't tie your previous thought and that's okay. There is not one right way of constructing a thought. I loved the little janitor scenes. The randomness of them gave me some stability even though it was the opposite. Idk... I really liked the movie... even though it is one of the most pretentious ones ive seen in a while. This movie is the kind of movie that people will call a 'film' and I don't disagree.

"Netflix is losing its place as the top streaming service, at least in terms of qualityNetflix has been great for a number of years, but it seems like now, they've exhausted every trick they had left in their hat, to the point where HBO Max and Hulu now have better titles and things to watch than Netflix does, hands down. Netflix is still the king of originals, hands down. They are damn good for their Netflix originals. Hulu has way more anime to watch, and a far better selection of Fox TV shows. They're originals definitely are not as good as Netflix. Funimation is the best place to find even more anime. Disney plus has the best Disney cartoons, Star wars movies. HBO Max has studio Ghibli, and far better TV shows and movies than Netflix does.


As you can see, Netflix is easily losing The streaming war, at least in terms of pure quality of streaming stuff. All they have is their Netflix originals. Their TV shows aren't really that great, Their movies are not really that great. They definitely don't have as much anime. The fact that Hulu has more anime then Netflix is very telling of the quality of Netflix going down the drain",0,1143,207

"Someone hacked into my account and changed my phone number to their own.If this is the wrong place to post this question, I apologize and I‚Äôll go ahead and delete. But I figured I would ask. So some random person signed into my Netflix account from across the country. I got a email notification from Netflix saying that my number was changed to my own number. I thought that was weird. Then I got another notification right after saying the number had been changed again, but the last two digits in the phone number preview weren‚Äôt mine. I think he was trying to change the number the first time, but messed up.

So I immediately logged in and saw where the phone number was changed. I guess this guy was trying to link his phone number to my account. I now know his full number, because the dude listed it, and it‚Äôs valid. So I don‚Äôt know if that was dumb on his part. I immediately changed my password and signed out of all devices. I checked my most recent activity and saw the unauthorized login and saw two emails from Netflix saying he signed in on his phone and web browser and it matched the device activity. He was just starting to watch a show too. Bummer. But I guess my main concern has to do with my phone number. I‚Äôm assuming this person has my number, so I‚Äôm thinking it might be a bad idea to verify my phone number to be used for account recovery. I wasn‚Äôt sure if you could use your phone number to recover the account, if it will let you bypass the password. So I‚Äôm leaving it unverified. I‚Äôm also a little worried he might be able to access the account again since he got in the first time. With me changing the password, changing the number back to mine, and signing out of all devices, should that keep this person out for good?",0,1751,331

"How to Access Older Profile Icons?So, when you set your profile icon, you get a selection of shows to pick from, but I know I've previously had access to profile icons from other shows than the once currently visible. I'd like to browse more than just the few ones it has available for me, but idk if that's possible, or if it is, how?",0,335,64
"Netflix repeatedly turns off all my monitors when browsingI have 3 monitors set up on my computer. Whenever I browse Netflix on just one monitor (doesn't matter which one) it will turn them all off and on every few seconds. Repeatedly.

I thought it had to do with which monitor I was watching Netflix on, but it doesn't. Turns them off and on whether I have the browser window open on my gaming monitor or my work monitors.

Also thought it had to do with if I was hovering over an icon and it started playing the video automatically (terrible design idea imo), but it doesn't matter there either. It's actually worse when I'm scrolling without hovering, as it will cut out for several seconds every few scrolls.

&amp;#x200B;

I immediately felt it was precisely the spot where Rey first encounters Kylo Ren. Does it not look almost exactly like the location of [this *The Force Awakens* scene? (sorry for quality)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mu6eejX-R-8&amp;t=94)

Now I haven't been able to find a citation for the location of the ""Forests"" title shot, but considering the production and crew are the [same ones who worked on BBC's *Planet Earth*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Planet) and others, it's not outside the realm of possibility that they would pick this uniquely fantastical little setting for the shot.

"Does Lost in Space get any better in Seasons 2 and 3?Ok I'm in a bit of a drought regarding good scifi. I started Lost in Space yesterday. There's so many problems with this show. It treats the viewer like an absolute donkey regarding science. After having watched the Expanse I cringe when John needs to put seemingly pure magnesium on fire with a lighter to melt ice or water freezing from the bottom up in the first place. Dr. Smith is just painfully annoying and I don't know if it's a writing or an acting problem or both, but how exactly do people constantly get manipulated by her? Her attempts are incredibly obvious.

Every episode there's a big problem to overcome which they to an extent fail to do but in the next episode they magically overcome the problem in its entirety by finding a convenient new solution nobody thought of before. Also, how exactly is this the creme de la creme of human kind? Those people are incredibly dumb when it's most important yet somehow this 8 year old has the skills of an engineer when nothing particular is happening. Perry or however his first sister is called contributes absolutely nothing except for some comedic relief.

I am watching the first seasons finale right now and it seems to have lost my interest 2 or 3 episodes ago. 

So does it get better in the next season? I'm starved for a good scifi show and if this continues I need something else to fill that hole.",0,1422,258

"Opinion: Trailers should stop spoiling the movie/showMy example here is going to be *Lucifer*. I have never seen the show. Don't really have any intention of ever watching it. However, I know quite a bit about it, simply because I have an understanding of the hero's journey and I've seen the trailer for each season. 

For instance, in the latest season, the fact that Lucifer is not actually Lucifer and is Michael, should not be something revealed in the trailer. It's a spoiler. And then, when real Lucifer comes back and they duke it out, I know very well what is going to happen. They battle, Lucifer gets defeated initially, has an epiphany, and defeats Michael. 

Of course I have no clue if any other important characters die, or if this battle doesn't actually end here in season 4, the details elude me, etc. But I should not be able to intuit all of that from seeing the trailer.

Trailers are supposed to bring people in to watch the show/movie, because the trailer gives us a taste of the mystery, and then leaves off on a black screen right before it shows who/what/where. This doesn't only apply to Netflix, I just figured it reach a bunch of people here, and I don't know of other subreddits to post it on. 

I understand that this could be perceived as violating Rule 9. My argument is that it is not a suggestion for Netflix, merely an observation of the way that companies have been advertising their products.",0,1430,255

"True and the Rainbow Kingdom (Netflix Kids) is a post apocalyptic nightmare hellscapeThis one is for all yall parents of little girls out there like me who have probably seen this damned show all the way through 100 times.  *True* isn't the result of a wonderful child's imagination, it's the grim dark reality of an alternate timeline where a little girl found a Genie's Bottle and was granted three actual, supernaturally powerful wishes.  

Her three wishes?

*I wish everyone in the world would play with me all the time.*  

One of the top dreams of every young child unhappy with the world in which they've been born, dissapointed that mom and dad have to do things like work and cleaning, angry that the kids at school can be mean to her, frustrated that so many different cute animals show antipathy towards her.  All she wants in her world is to be the center of attention, as she is in her own mind, for what people do and say to reflect how she thinks. She wants the world to operate like in her favorite books, games shows - which leads to her second wish...

*I wish real life were like TV.*

TV, where the colors are bright and cartoonish, where animals talk, and where magic is real.  In her mind things are always so much more mysterious and special than they seem to be in real life, where discovering the true realities of things can be both difficult and depressing. On TV she sees a world in her cartoons that match that internal vision.  There, she sees a world which lives up to the promise that adults keep telling her exists.  

But this whole experience has been so incredible, and she doesn't want it to end.  She wants to be able to have fun like this forever.  She would not have the emotional maturity to care about the fact that every human and animal on the planet were now mind trapped in her childish desires, compelled to go along with her games and whims, their bodies torturously disfigured into cartoonish visages of wonder and pain.  The planet transformed from its astronomically formed, geologically sculpted, billion year beauty to a blob of impossible unreality floating obstinately through space.  

It isn't enough, though.  A child given all of their desires will not learn satisfaction, but rather will cultivate newer and more complex yet base desires.  And thus, for her third and final wish...

*I wish I could keep making wishes with all my friends, forever.*

Which gives us the genesis of the Wishing Tree, and the final immortal seal on this tomb of horrors, which will lash its victims with its sisyphean adventures which will begin anew long after the particles which entail the rest of the real universe evaporate into a cold, dead reality.  Would that it were so for the poor souls trapped in the Rainbow Kingdom.",0,2770,486

"That houseI‚Äôve seen a lot of posts about the house, and how the Watts were having some difficulty with the mortgage. When I look at that house, I think of the marriage. The house was made entirely in Shannan‚Äôs image. It was very feminine. A lot of pastel accent colors, those plastic orange plants in the kitchen, and even floral writing on the closet walls. He was pulling in the majority of their income, but that house was not his at all. Chris‚Äô only space was the unfinished basement. 
I think even Agent Tammy Lee mentioned  this in the Feb ‚Äò19 interview.

Clearly house decor should not result in a quadruple homicide, but it always made me think it added to Chris‚Äô feeling that he was not in control of his life. The murders, to me, were about not just rage, but control. Everything in their lives leading up to that morning was Shannan‚Äôs idea, and under Shannan‚Äôs control. I am not victim blaming, just positing a theory on the motive.

The family (3 children), the marriage, moving to Colorado, the expensive house, the expensive school, the lack of income to pay for all this stuff. I think him snapping had a lot to do with wanting to take back control. Remember, he was a mechanic. Chris was, is, a guy that dealt in real world analytics. He knew their way of life had already become unsustainable. He knew it wasn‚Äôt what he wanted. That house speaks volumes.",0,1371,248

"No original audio in Inglorious Basterds in Germany?!So Netflix is normally really good about audio and subtitles. Depending on where you are in the world there will be a myriad of options for subtitles and audio and it‚Äôs easy to switch between any available language. And I‚Äôve NEVER seen a movie that doesn‚Äôt have it‚Äôs original audio.

But inglorious Basterds in Germany is missing just that. And this wasn‚Äôt always the case, by the way. So yeah, this movie that features 4 languages has all the original audio *except* for the English dialog, which is dubbed over in German. Of all the movies you could dub over, this one makes about the least god damn sense. 

For me personally, watching synchronized movies is intolerable and unacceptable, and I‚Äôve never seen Netflix do this for any other movie, let alone a blockbuster Tarantino flick. So I‚Äôm really scratching my head about why they got rid of the original language. 

Does it have something to do with the subject matter and it being in Germany? Did they see something inappropriate in the original movie and change it for the German audience? It‚Äôs one of my favorite movies and I‚Äôm just super annoyed I can‚Äôt watch it (on Netflix anymore).",0,1199,207

"Netflix having a separate app or section where you can watch shows with strangers???(I might misspell stuff because I‚Äôm just ranting) 

OKAY HEAR ME OUT I JUST HAD THIS IDEA because I was watching a reaction channel on YouTube to a show, but it‚Äôs the one channel I‚Äôve seen do almost the whole episode without getting copyrighted. I feel like it feels so comfortable to be able to watch this with someone? Specially with corona and not being able to go out, there‚Äôs definitely something about it because channels like this get so many views, but I thought of it like a twitch game, but instead of watching someone play, you watch them react or watch with them. There could be multiple options. Maybe this is already happening on twitch or discord or something, or maybe it‚Äôs really not that great of an idea, but it got in my head and I had to share it so that‚Äôs it now. Thanks for reading. üòÖüòÖ

"Unpopular Opinion: Netflix is pushing the limit too much. Please read, before downvoting.Read before downvoting this. It's not a secret that Netflix has a certain agenda. You can be in favor of it or hate it. That's not up for discussing. If you don't like it you can cancel your subscription. I'm not in favor of it, but I can live with it. In the beginning, you had sense8, it was different and a gamechanger because of the characters. If you liked it you watched, otherwise, you skipped. It was a well-liked series and showed the vision and policy of the company. For some reason, it got canceled. After canceling a couple of things started to change. More characters with LGBT backgrounds appeared on the series that we do not see regularly see on the screen. This was not really an issue, it got certain comments and of course, hate messages. It became a bit annoying when it was getting pushed too much into the narrative of popular series. Sometimes it worked and most of the time it just looked acquired and forced, especially in existing series where it was used as a big part of the plot. And every series started to get the same treatment. 

  
 Until this point, I don't have any issues with it. I don't like it, but like I said it's Netflix you either leave it or subscribe. You can enjoy a good story without agreeing to every political message/opinion it tries to push for. But the series Cuties has gone too far. Normally the running joke is on every teen series/movie every teen is played by a forty-year-old. There is a reason for this, you don't sexualize underages actors or don't put them in that position.

This isn't the first time ive been trying to fix this issue, if there is even a fix. But anything i watch on Netflix is in poor Quality, if i had to compare it to something it would be 480p Youtube Quality. 

My internet connection isn't the issue, atleast i dont believe so. Speedtests say i have around 30 Mbps download and 32 Mbps Upload.

What ive tried:

Different browsers (Microsoft edge is supposed to go up to 4k, still looks bad)

turned on/off hardware acceleration 

Playback settings are high (best quality)

Change monitors

switch between wifi and cable

Yes, believe it or not. I have restarted my Computer AND Router.

"Does Netflix having a SD-only plan make sense in 2020?As we all know Netflix got three plans : Basic with SD and one screen at once, Standard with HD and 2 screens and Premium with UHD HDR and 4 screens. 

Of course, the price increases with the number of screens which seems logical since many people use those higher plans with several people, not even necessarily in the same house since they don't control that at all.

But what seems weird to me is that Basic plan? Having a plan for one screen may be logical, many people probably don't share it or are fine with one but that plan is still only SD. Who is watching only SD in 2020?

It also make no sense because that Basic plan is actually the most expensive one if you count per user and yet, it got the worst quality. Does Netflix want people to share subscriptions instead? 

We can also see that most other streaming services aren't working like that and don't have a cheaper plan with less screens and less quality.",0,977,181

Since these are only specific to the Japanese voices, the subtitles end up not matching what's actually said in the English dubs. Sure, both the voices and the texts basically present the same ideas, but the fact that they're not identical makes it inconsistent and that really bothers me. I end up having to turn off the subtitles entirely whenever I'm watching a dub. I wish they would have an option to have closed captions specific for English dubs.

"Weird Audio Glitch.So at 2am I was just casually binging Netflix using my wireless headphones when suddenly the left side started playing louder. I figured my headphones broke, being rather pissed considering I love those things I switched to dreaded wired earbuds, and low and behold.. same issue. 

I made a conclusion and thought it might just be my iPhone 6s Plus finally giving out on me, so I gave up and went to bed. This morning I went to continue my binge on my laptop, with the same wireless headphones. But the exact same issue occurred on my laptop, left side being way louder than the right. So, I switched between two different pairs of earbuds and my wireless headphones, playing Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Prime, and YouTube on my phone, laptop, and brothers phone. Same damn issue, every pair of headphones, all with just the Netflix application. 

In conclusion, there‚Äôs a weird glitch with Netflix currently it seems where the left side of headphones/earbuds/speakers play noticeably louder on each device and pair of headphones I try to listen on.

"Cuties/Mignonnes will be out next Wednesday (9 Sept 2020), how do you think the reaction is going to turn out?First off, let's all just admit as of today on (31st Aug 2020), barely anyone have seen the movie. It was only released at the Sundance Film Festival and is shown in theatres in France so audience is very limited.

The outrage started 10 days ago over the promotional poster, which is understandably so, but the outrage bandwagon kinda went off the rails with so much misinformation. Claiming its a netflix series, it has sexually explicit scenes which requires the TV-MA rating, it was made for pedophiles, it shouldn't exist, etc. Youtuber hot-takes were all over the place and cuties was a trending topic on r/memes for days. There was even a petition for Netflix to stop the movie from releasing.

So today, the initial outrage has died off and now is mostly just some knee jerk reaction post. There's barely any post on Twitter or reddit about cuties today. Thought it would be a good opportunity to come out with some speculation.

So among all the outrage, there were a few of the more level headed youtubers who gave out a more logical take on the movie.

[https://youtu.be/Cd4UgKViYq4](https://youtu.be/Cd4UgKViYq4)

While the Netflix marketing did give a bad first impression, a bit of googling would have easily cleared some misunderstanding. Netflix did not make this movie, its an acquired movie just like a bunch of other movies they have. It was shown at the Sundance Film Festival with ok to good reception, winning an award and no complaints of sexualizing any of the cast. It was released in French theatres with a G rating, ok to good review and again, no complaints of sexualizing any of the cast.

So, even without watching the movie, I can speculate that a lot of the outrage was kinda false. There's no way an entire country's movie rating board would be ok with it if really has a pedo materials. But we still need to wait for the movie to be out to properly judge it.

So, how do you think its gonna play out come 9 Sept?

First, I think there will be a divide on the internet between the ""have never and will never see this disgusting movie"" crowd and the ones who gave it a chance crowd.

Right now, most of the outrage come from youtube commentators rather than actual movie reviewing youtubers. The movie reviewers are very quiet on the matter, not even a single post about Cuties/Mignonnes anywhere. Once the movie is out and they give their review proper, anyone who give an ok to good review is gonna get some backlash and their fans will come to defend them.

Right now Netflix's trailer for Cuties/Mignonnes sits at 34k likes and 1.4mil dislikes. I doubt we will have a reverse but if the movie is indeed as good as the Sundance reviews are, I'm guessing we'll see a 25% like ratio. Maybe the like will bump out to 250k at best.

Most of the first rage youtube commentators will either double down on their stance or change their stance from ""this movie is bad"" to ""this movie is not my taste but Netflix marketing team is still bad"".",0,3078,547

"Any particular reason Netflix removes English voice language from foreign films?I went to put on Initial D and it's literally not letting me put it in English any more. I know for a fact it used to be there. I'm pretty sure there are a few other movies they've done this with as well. What gives?

(To note: I enjoy watching movies in Cantonese or Mandarin with subtitles most of the time, but I was just putting it on in the background to listen to while I played a game on the computer. Hero with Jet Li is my absolute favorite movie and 9/10 I just watch it subtitled. My fiancee flat out won't watch these movies with me anymore though if I can't put English language on. I've read subtitles my whole life due to my mother being hearing impaired but she can't stand it.)",0,774,146

"UK netflix apocalyptic / dystopian teen recs like The Society, The 100, 3%So I watched The Society as soon as it came out and have rewatched it several times since. It quickly became one of my favourite shows and I'm absolutely crushed by the recent news re. netflix's decision not to renew it for a s2. In my opinion it had the best writing, themes, characterisation, mystery, casting.

I think part of why I love it so much is because I love the premise of, group of teens have to come together to deal with something by themselves, bonus points if it's dystopian. When I had amazon prime I got really into the 100 but my membership ran out before I finished. This is another example of a show that I think has executed this trope really well. I also have watched and loved 3%.

I've tried to watch Between (netflix original), which has a similar premise, several times but can't get past the first ep. The actors are so bland and boring and I'm not convinced by the story or the ensemble.

Does anyone have any suggestions of shows on UK netflix that you know of, that I might enjoy? I was thinking about The Rain but I don't know if it's quite what I'm looking for.",0,1169,218

Normally that would be perfectly ok, however, since this is a Spanish show, in the raw version, they told her to record it in Spanish, but in the English version that wouldn‚Äôt make sense at all, her speaking British only to be asked to speak Spanish to then speak English, so instead of thinking out something fitting for her to say, they just used a cop-out to fill in the sub there by asking her to make it quick.

 I tried to resubscribe to Netflix using my debit card, and every-time I get a message saying "" There appears to be a problem with the payment method you are trying to use "". I tried switching browsers(chrome, safari, firefox..), I am 100 percent sure that I have funds in my bank, I tried 2 different banks and 3 different debit cards, I also tried paying on my TV, on my phone, on my laptop, the same issue persists every time I try to pay. I switched Wi-Fi, I still got the same message.

After some googling, I found out that some people have the same issue, and they get over it by buying a gift card. So, I did just that. I got a gift card for 25‚Ç¨ and when I add the code, I get a message saying that I got 25‚Ç¨ credit, but I still have to add a payment method. When I try to add a payment method, the same issue persists, the message: ""There appears to be a problem with the payment method you are trying to use.""

I spoke with support 2 times, in the end i just got some web links and they told me that I should contact my bank, AND that my gift card code does not work...
