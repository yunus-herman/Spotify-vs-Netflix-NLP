spotify,"I recently bought a samsung phone (several months ago) and got a free premium subscription to youtube music and am blown away by the sound quality. Everything is just louder and crisper. I liked it so much that I kept paying for it on top of spotify. 

But I've missed the social aspect of spotify's playlists. Being able to stay on top of the newest trending songs, having a desktop app, etc. But everytime I open it up, I can hear how muddled everything is. Then I open that same song in YT Music and it's like the wax is taken out of my ears.

Just today I was listening to SZA's newest song, Good Days because it was on top of the top 50 (yesterday). The intro just sounded weird. So I opened it on YT music and played it on my built-in laptop speakers. Suddenly I notice their are birds chirping in the background, kids yelling , little record scratches/chirping effects, all of these things add up to a really evocative intro that I can't even hear in the intro to the spotify version *after realizing its there*.

I just really need spotify to get their shit together so I can stop paying for two services.",Spotify sound quality is trash

spotify,"So, I see a lot of complaints about how repetitive the Spotify radio has become.  

Well, I agree. But I think I found a way to make it be less so.  

So, type in the name of a song you like and let the radio take over. But instead of listening to the song, skip the rest of it. And then keep skipping every song that you have heard a million times that come after.  I have found that what happens is that all of a sudden I start getting new songs that I haven't heard before. You maybe have to skip as many as 10 songs or so, but it does seem to work.

spotify,[removed],Spotify struggling with Chromecast connection
spotify,"Just started using spotify again (last time I used it was maybe 2 years ago).  I set up a new account, added playlists, some are downloaded.  I played some music over the past day, which couldn't have accounted for an hour of playtime, and it's used over 2 gb of my cellular data.  I have downloads over cellular turned off.  I get that streaming will use cellular data if I haven't downloaded the particular playlist, but I can't understand how it's used that much data for so little use.  Are there any troubleshooting steps I should try?  I'm using android phones.

Edit, to be explicit--the Spotify app itself has used over 2gb of cellular data, but I've only listened to music through it for maybe an hour tops.

Second edit--apparently I'm not alone, and this isn't an android-specific issue, it's a way that Spotify behaves in general.  It's been most-recently complained about here:  https://community.spotify.com/t5/iOS-iPhone-iPad/Spotify-using-mobile-data-even-when-cellular-data-turned-off/m-p/5083015/highlight/true

Basically even if you have playlist downloads turned off for cell data, if you are listening to a playlist that you have downloaded, the playlist can still ""update"" over cellular data.  This is completely ridiculous.  The only workaround is going into offline mode, which is kind of dumb.","Over 2gb of cellular data used the past 24 hours, but I've only listened to spotify for maybe an hour tops"

spotify,"Okay, so first of all, the Spotify update has its sweet points; folders to organize my playlists, hotkey manuals, ....... THAT'S IT!


The new Spotify update (desktop) sucks, and I think all my friends can agree with this. People can't copy and paste songs from playlists anymore, switching from playlists will always bring you to the top (good, if you're not sorting out a playlist of 200..), you can't sort by artist as easily, searching for songs become more tedious, I can't just click a song title in the search page to pull out the album, if I add a bunch of songs into a playlist and you have some of them already in it, they seldom notify that there are duplicates, having to confirm when using the delete key when deleting multiple songs, and many more.


But the worst is definitely the playlists. I think the inclusion of album arts can be appealing to some, but not for me. Weirdly enough, Spotify has not implemented a feature where you can choose what to show in the playlists. Not only that, everything is sort of worse, performance-wise... If I scroll through my playlist, it loads, it did not use to load... 


Arranging song orders used to be okay, but now, if I delete something, it basically has a chance to just scramble my playlist, and I don't know why... This really made me give up organising my song orders... THIS HAPPENED TO ME TWICE, A MONTH AGO, AND JUST NOW. PLAYLIST OF 300 SONGS, I WAS HALFWAY FINISHED, AND IT SCRAMBLED ITSELF BECAUSE OF SOME REASON. Ctrl + z don't work, and honestly, I'm about to give up organising my playlist... This app is really trying to push me over the edge, and I just decided to go premium just now...",What the hell is happening with my playlist?

spotify,"I‚Äôve recently realised that there are so many official Spotify Playlists that I‚Äôve never seen. Some of them I only found when I search for playlists with the name of the genre/any random word, some of them by scrolling through Spotify‚Äôs account. Some of them are really good. 
I don‚Äôt understand why the page for each genre only shows ‚ÄúPopular Playlists‚Äù. Just put them all there. 

Also, and maybe this is actually common knowledge, but apparently these playlists aren‚Äôt the same for everyone? When I was putting on music from my friend‚Äôs phone, the songs on ‚ÄòVolume‚Äô were completely different. It wasn‚Äôt because it was updated or anything, they were still the same on my phone. 

Sometimes they have really random names, or they‚Äôre unrelated to the songs. And the descriptions sometimes name artists that aren‚Äôt actually on the playlists. There are several playlists with the same name. I‚Äôve found like three called ‚Äú90‚Äôs workout‚Äù, all from Spotify‚Äôs account. Were the 2000s some sort of golden age for jazz? Because both ‚Äúsmooth jazz 2000‚Äù and ‚Äúvocal jazz 2000‚Äù exist, but equivalents for other decades don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre AI generated, but Spotify seems to claim they‚Äôre not, unless I‚Äôve misunderstood. 

On top of that, there‚Äôs the fact that you can‚Äôt filter searches. This is probably relevant for more people here. Every time I try to decide what to listen to, I wish I could just use filters, like what Ultimate Guitar has where you start with literally everything they have and you can start narrowing it down.

They don‚Äôt even let you see every genre/mood! It‚Äôs pretty much a guessing game. Nevermind the fact that we know they sort things into way more genres/subgenres than what users can see classified as such. Spotify‚Äôs been telling me my favourite genre is ‚Äúpermanent wave‚Äù for years. Then let me see what it is! 

They have these collections of playlists that go together, but they don‚Äôt let you browse them.

What‚Äôs the point? What‚Äôs their endgame here? If it‚Äôs to get people to spend hours hyper-fixating on this and trying to figure out what‚Äôs going on instead of actually listening to music, well they‚Äôve succeeded. Sorry for the rant, it‚Äôs just really frustrating.",Why does Spotify insist on burying playlists? Are they trying to make it hard to find music?

**[LYNGUISTICS - Blues x Hip-Hop](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/628bofbI24qf24gpU0aurB?si=6rCpfHUoSIu4Vy_q3pR8Zw)** / While this is a blues x hip-hop playlist, it's pretty much explored through the focus of one group: Cunninlynguists.

It is a 1-hour list of classical music, songs that I really like, whose tempo goes up and down.

If you like to listen to music while reading a book, I would definitely recommend that you play it once in a short reading session. I collected the list for this purpose and continue to add it. Or a list that will go well while working, even if it finishes a few times and starts over.

The list take just 1 hour, but as I listen to classical music, I make additions from time to time. So you can follow the list if you like it.

Thanks and wish you all good listening &lt;3",Classical music list (may be nice to reading)

spotify,"I'm a big user of the radio and weekly discovery. Sometimes after going into a rabbit hole, I find something of a completely different genre and I want to find more of it. So naturally I start a radio based on that song/artist.

The issue here is that it will add songs that aren't remotely the same as the thing I'm using the radio for. It is adding songs that are more like my recently listened to genres/artists. It really defeats the point of radio-ing on a specific song or artist outside of the genres I've listened to over the last few months.

For example, I'm attempting to find more Japanese ""chillhop"". I've found a couple artists doing this genre, put them in a playlist, and started a radio on it. Only a fraction of the results are somewhat like the songs in the list, the rest is all just j-pop, instrumental, or variations of EDM.

Is there a way to start a radio with a ""clean"" profile, so to speak, not biased by my listening history?","Radio without using personal flavor/""preferences""?"

spotify,"There is a volume setting which can be accessed easily from the quick menu. The problem is that the very lowest option is what I would consider half volume. And if you move it down to 0 from 1 it just turns it completely off. 


And the highest option is either extremely high or its extremely high and boosts the bass and sometimes it blurs whatever is being said in the song when there is intense bass and all you hear is the bass covering the words(this doesn't happen at max volume on pc and it still sounds just as loud but the words aren't covered by the base). I imagine if I had crappy headphones it would be even worse and I'd hear absolutely nothing else.


Either way it would be way better if the lowest volume option was no sound and the first tick was nearly non-exist. I have to stop my music sometimes just to hear footsteps in games. For it being the console app where it's supposed to be easy since you can't just adjust the volume levels for separate applications like on pc it's really annoying that the lowest option is basically the same volume as the game audio. 


When the slider is at 50-75% it's as loud as music needs to be listened too. There is absolutely no need to go all the way to the farthest tick. I definitely think that the bass is boosted as well, since even at that level the bass sounds shaky on good headphones.

- Best algorithmic playlist by far
- Great tool to discover new music
- Easy to curate playlists
- A lot of well curated editorial lists
- Great UI and nice design

After trying Apple Music, Amazon and Tidal, I‚Äôm like, yea why even complain? Amazon was a big disappointment and Apple music, I‚Äôm not impressed.

spotify,"I switched to Spotify about half a decade ago from Apple Music because Spotify was far superior for discovering new music. That‚Äôs the name of the game for me. Idk if others are experiencing similar things, but Spotify has been really decreasing in quality lately...

To start, my discover weekly for the last couple years has been nothing but songs from previous discover weekly‚Äôs that Ive heard and deliberately didn‚Äôt add to my library.. so Spotify should know I don‚Äôt like those songs

Additionally, any song radio that I make is comprised of songs that are already in my library, like Spotify thinks Im trying to make my own daily mix. No. I‚Äôm trying to find new songs. 

The hide button on mobile is too hidden, the app glitches, you can‚Äôt remove a song from a playlist on mobile, you can‚Äôt adjust EQ on desktop, and the fact that Spotify still doesn‚Äôt have an independently working app for the Apple Watch is a joke. 

To not be a total downer I will say I quite like the equalizer (even if it isn‚Äôt on desktop, I don‚Äôt think Apple has it), collaborative playlists, crossfading, how easy it is to transition from listening on different devices, and the social aspects of the app.",Considering leaving Spotify...

\--------

I just want to make a playlist with one artist's discography in chronological order. **What I need is a release date column.** On Windows.

Playing from artist page doesn't work for me, because the artist in question has worked with a sex offender or two that I refuse to support financially, so my goal is to make a discography playlist and remove the songs with problematic artists. (FYI: Fat Nick and Pouya are actual rapists. Look for the Twitter thread.) So, making a discography playlist: how hard can it be? Well...

* From the artist page, I would have to

1. select all songs from a given EP/LP
2. drag to playlist in sidebar, or right click and select ""add to playlist"" &gt; playlistName.
3. Multiplied by every EP or LP.

* For ""Appears On"" (features), it gets worse:

1. click the project
2. find the songs featuring the artist
3. add to playlist
4. navigate backwards to get to the next project.
5. Multiplied by every featured track.

What I ***should*** be able to do:

1. Go to artist page
2. Select all tracks &gt; Add to playlist
3. Sort playlist by release date and play as is, or copy sorted playlist to new playlist for a permanently chronological discography playlist.

The problem with this is that selecting songs from multiple albums at once on artist page is not supported, and ""Appears On"" tracks are hidden behind another layer of navigation, so they can't be multi-selected.

The easy way ***would*** be to

1. search artist name
2. sort by release date
3. select all &gt; add to playlist

However, the order of tracks in search results is based on popularity, so there is no chance of this method being feasible: the songs from a given project are interspersed with others, and the resulting playlist would be a mess. For search results, it's not even possible to click a column to sort (by album in this case) so I can cross reference my new playlist with artist page and then sort whole projects by date manually. **Column sorting should be enabled for search results.** You might think this isn't an option because sorting very long search results is resource-intensive. However, the feature could be disabled for results of &gt;= X length ‚Äî say, 100 or 500 results ‚Äî and they are already sorted by popularity, so this is bogus.

I should at least have the **option** to enable a release date column that I can use to sort playlists and search results. **iTunes had this figured out over a decade ago.** I have paid Spotify hundreds of dollars over the years, and they are still so far behind. I just want to listen to one of my favorite artists for a couple hours without supporting rapists. Is that too much to ask?!?

Another solution for me would be to permanently forbid playing songs by a particular artist. Like a blocked list. This isn't an option either. The lack of this effectively ruins playing from some artist pages or community playlists for me, and forces me to make playlists. Also, playing from artist page doesn't play ""Appears On"" tracks. 

Right now the absurd, convoluted solution to making a chronological discography playlist is this:

1. Search artist name
2. Select all and add to playlist 1
3. Sort playlist 1 by album
4. Select all and add to playlist 2
5. Go to artist page and find earliest project
6. Go to playlist 2
7. Move earliest project to top of playlist (or bottom depending on desired order)
8. Repeat steps 5-8 for every project
9. Use Google to determine which LPs/EPs/features from the same year came first and adjust accordingly

What a pain. I thought I was using the best music streaming service out there. I'm starting to think I was wrong.",Rant about missing features that hinder the creation of a chronological discography playlist. Guide to achieving this at end of post.

Went to [last.fm](https://last.fm) to check if it's a Discord problem, and sure enough, my music didn't appear there either. Neither did my phone in ""Connect to a device tab"". To make this situation even weirder, liking songs/updating playlists seems to work just fine. That's why I switched to the browser player, because there everything worked just fine.

I tried reinstalling the client multiple times over the past, downloading from both the Spotify website and Microsoft store to no avail. I also tried reconnecting [last.fm](https://last.fm) and Discord and that didn't work either. Tried setting everything to 'offline' for it to refresh and that didn't work either. Honestly at this point i don't even know I should just go ahead and reinstall Windows.

As everyone who likes anime probably knows for the longest time a lot of older anime songs have not been available on US Spotify, but it seems that a lot of it for whatever reason has now been made available at the same time.

I have noisy upstairs neighbors. Like, they tap dance with a mountain goat at like 6:30 in the morning. I work nights. They wake me up all the time and it's a real inconvenience. I've started sleeping with background noise to try to improve my quality of sleep. Mostly I've been using things like video game soundtracks or soundscapes just to give a little bit of background noise so they're stomping around doesn't bother me as much.

after a couple of weeks my discover weekly was nothing but a bunch of ambient dreamy soundscapes and that's really boring. I mostly listen to metal and EDM so that's a big change for me. All of my playlists are metal and/or EDM. I read about how to wrangle discover weekly and made a bunch of new playlists and stopped listening to soundscapes.

That was about 3 weeks ago. I've continued to make playlists out of music that I do want to hear, but discover weekly is only giving me soft dreamy soundscapes. What can I do to expedite the change?",Retraining discover weekly?

spotify,"I have struggled over the past 2 years to really choose one of the two services and stick to it. I use mostly Apple products and love the design of Apple Music, the way the library works, the artist radio, lyrics feature and the way the CarPlay app works. However, Spotify has some cool features including the ability to see what friends are listening to, live group sessions, and the queue being better as well. Curious what many of you use (assuming Spotify in this sub) and how you came to your decision? I will also be posting this in a few other subs to just get thoughts.",Apple Music vs Spotify in Q1 2021

About Spotify though - he has noticed that a couple of times a month a lot of his songs will get close to 4 or 5 hundred extra listens a day and all of these come from a place called Riverside in California. And of course this causes a fairly ugly and obvious and possibly fake spike in his listenship.

He says it looks like what paid listens would look like but of course he doesn't do that.

Anyone know anything it could be (its definitely not genuine listens - couple be 400 listens each for 8 songs in one day) or does riverside have a particular significance for Spotify?

'Trellis, distributed by trac . co'

'Puna Plains, distributed by trac . co'

spotify,"I don‚Äôt know how many of you know this, but there‚Äôs a feature where you can add MP3 files to Spotify. In the event Spotify doesn‚Äôt have a specific song or audio file you want to listen to, you can just get the MP3 file of the song/video and save to a folder on your laptop, so that it will show up in the local files tab on your desktop. To make the Local Files tab show up you need to go into advanced settings and turn it on. The only downside is that only you can view the song, because only you have the MP3 file on your desktop. 

Once you add the file to a playlist, it will pop up on your phone (I‚Äôd recommend keeping your phone open to the playlist you want to add the song to, because it sometimes doesn‚Äôt show up if your phone is turned off while you add the song onto a playlist from your desktop). You can‚Äôt add local files through your phone alone. They will show up accessible on your phone if you add it through desktop.

You can also add album art by going thru iTunes (or any other desktop media player) and adding artwork to the song. You‚Äôd first need to drag and drop the file into whichever media player you‚Äôre using. 

A lot of my friends use Spotify and they had no idea you could do all this. So in the event people are not aware of this feature, I thought I‚Äôd just mention it here on Reddit. Happy listening!

The first and second movements are also in different albums in this specific case, so a playlist was more or less necessary.

The file in question plays for five minutes, but the length displays for 14 seconds in the playlist. Here's a [screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/hzM1Ju0.jpg). I've also tried a one minute file, which also displays 14 seconds for whatever reason. Didn't attach a picture for that one because I'm lazy.

Don't tell me that there is no such option. This app is ~10 years old.
I love Spotify but many small things are making me wonder what the fuck they are doing. 

Stuff like:
- Selecting multiple tracks at once.
- Undoing a missclick, like by mistake deleting a track.
- Not having to wait a fucking second to click an option under ""more options"" because some options appear later which makes you missclick.
- WHY THE FUCK CAN'T ""FIND IN PLAYLIST"" BE ON TOP OF THE SCREEN LIKE IT USED TO?
- If someone is following my playlist I should be able to see, at least, username of that account.
- If someone visits my profile they should see the playlist like I sort them and in their folders, AND half of my library is not even showing (I have many playlist).

BTW, did this team earlier this year delete the widget for Spotify? (I know it's back).

I'm starting to wonder if the developers of this app are using it themselves.

You showed me something you thought I might like. You were wrong. Why in the HELL can I not nuke this from orbit and NEVER see it again?

spotify,"I started listening to some copyright free music playlists.  On the playlists, there might be 100-200 songs, but I don't like 15-30 of them.  I could maybe go down the playlist and manually add one song at a time to a newly created personal playlist and then remove the ones I don't like.  That would take some time.  Maybe there are some hacks and tricks to do it faster.  But then the playlist won't get any updates.  I mean what if the original playlist creator was still working on their playlist and adding new songs each day?  It would be better and make more sense to click on the song in that person's playlist and then select ""ignore song"" from the menu.  So when the previous song is done playing, it will try to play the ignored song, realize it is ignored, and then just skip it and play the next song.  Is that so hard to implement?","Let us ""ignore"" (skip) songs on other people's playlists."

The album 'Dead and Buried' by Jungle Rot doesn't work on Spotify, anyone know why? Searching for it through Spotify (app or website) shows no results, but the google link to the album on Spotify takes you to it, however you cannot play any of the songs (see link below).

Anyone more clued up on Spotify able to shed some light on what's going on? Is this some copyright dispute that's removed the album from being played or something?

When I follow the album link from my, say ""Likes Songs"" playlist, when it's playing, it brings me to a view where it does show the correct ""likes"" and activity.

I have become increasingly frustrated with this app do to this issue. 
My commute takes me through an area where there is no service. That being the case I downloaded a lot of music to my device, the only registered device on my account. 
Still when there is no service I can't pull up albums or songs to start playing music, worse yet it stops playing in the middle of my commute when a song ends. I commute on a motorcycle so it isn't very straight forward for me to be fucking around with the app mid ride. 
I have also.doscovered that spotify has just undownloaded about 50% of my downloaded music. 

Why the hell is a premium paid for app of a publicly traded company so damn bad. It is literally their only fucking product. Google has tons of shit they make, I'll give them a pass if their music players sucks. 

Don't even get me started on the general poor UI experience.

[**BITTER SWEET SYMPHONIES - Violins of the British Isles**](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4cj5rylS8pDmrovtRbtJhe?si=ULDsCWkxTZaRKmuHMt8D0g) / *170+* songs of which 90% are indie-rock, with the rest made of classic rock &amp; pop and trip-hop with prominent violins from bands across the British Isles.

[**SLEEPWALKERS - Dreamy Indie/Pop**](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7nPWcacMWrOO5uEqM5i7bP?si=D4HmZN-NRmeYPtb4kH7Zjw) / Dream-pop (indie) weaved in between dreamy feeling pop/alt songs. *375* catchy floaty songs to get lost in.

[**UNTIL THE SUN NEEDS TO RISE -  Indie x House**](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4nJCyy4WBU88vRLEdWT9Vu?si=58zcvpWKQCuGApSKadraRA) / Dancey indie songs with a dum dum kinda beat mixed with mellow house with instrumentation and interesting layers going on. *210+* songs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***ELECTRONIC***

[**JAH WAR ‚Äì Sounds of Dread**]( https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6byGQms2WCbtP7lQP2jJSh?si=_858ku0ZTg2T5Wy2XgmM6Q) / This can be seen as a conceptual playlist for a Jamaican apocalyptic party (sounds of dread as in the sense of dread but also dreadlocks). But another musical way to look at is as a dancehall/dub/industrial playlist explored mainly through the sonic output of The Bug. *80+* songs.

[**DIESEL POWER ‚Äì Industrial x Electronic**]( https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4FF03inHf4SZ857sBZoIFS?si=XlNUYw71Ryu_H3hRSMFEYQ) / An energetic playlist of electronic songs with industrial aesthetics and vice versa with loose definitions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***HIP-HOP***

**[YOUNG KINGS &amp; QUEENS - UK Hip-Hop/CHILL](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1tXmfbEbqGUXdXnlMprM1N?si=rjwDnnb_RVODOKRf7Ps0wg)** / If you're a hip-hop fan who appreciates bars, I'd say you're pretty up to date with the UK scene if you listen to these *180+* songs and the next playlist.

**[SCARE THE SNARE - UK Hip-Hop/HYPE](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6Ybykk20eEI9p3DpXxv22N?si=YFgg_2kuStuY7CAu-SXeNA)** / More aggressive bars and beats on these *160+* tunes. But still no low effort rhymers.

**[THE BAY - Funk x Hip-Hop](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7gNuSGvIJldJ4XpiBIcxaO?si=-FjVroE5RlyfwYVC4IQaHw)** / *110+* songs of smooth, slick rhymers from The Bay in San Francisco (or close by) on funky production or bands.

**[LYNGUISTICS - Blues x Hip-Hop](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/628bofbI24qf24gpU0aurB?si=6rCpfHUoSIu4Vy_q3pR8Zw)** / While this is a blues x hip-hop playlist, it's pretty much explored through the focus of one group: Cunninlynguists. I hope you'll see why with *90+* songs of mellow soulful bluesy production.

**[BLUEGRASS STAIN'D - Blues-Rock x Hip-Hop](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6YKWBVOKzpbZ4I1ruO1NFs?si=3dJ1Zt8fQ5uT-vQtdYKHMQ)** / It would be a stretch to call all of the *190+* tracks on here blues-rock, but there is at least bluesy guitar. They're all hip-hop songs with differing ratios of blues and rock influence to the production, so probably one of the most varied hip-hop playlists.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***OTHER GENRES***

**[LET‚ÄôS GROOVE - A Trip Down Funkytown](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/24TtMVEkD9mpajyjimsKfx?si=NqyPCG_dSVK9B_eYxCLfcA)** / Get your Funk on with this playlist bridging the gap between oldschool funk and it's evolution and divergence since. *270+* songs.

spotify,"My biggest gripe is that jumping to songs by clicking on the album art is STILL bugged. I think the bug was introduced five years ago?

Another is the removal of jumping to artists or songs by typing. In other programs with lists (browsers, file explorers) you can just start typing something and it will be selected. Spotify had this feature in the olden days. It was suddenly removed and has never returned. You could even sort by artist, album or song and type to jump to them. It was a very smooth way of navigating a large playlist without having to use ctrl+F.

Can you believe that clicking album art still jumps to the wrong song? I first downloaded Spotify in 2008, and the current client is still a way worse experience. I'm also 99% sure that scrolling through playlists was a way smoother and faster experience on the old client.

I know I'm just shouting into the void here, but Spotify UI might be the biggest frustration in my daily life (maybe)",I am madly frustrated about the UI bugs that are never fixed

Some important points though, that you need to know before PMing me -


- we plan on taking a yearly plan which costs Rs. 2,159/- so we have to split as Rs. 360 per head. (which is Rs. 30 per month, as I mentioned above)

- Final payment will be done only after receiving the individual payments of all members. But this is negotiable. I'll add you to a whatsapp/discord group where we can talk and settle things, and you may pay only after you're convinced that we're not a scam.

- we're paying for a year cuz we want premium for long term usage. If you just wanna try out for a month or two you probably shouldn't PM me.

That's about it. Please feel free to ask any query in the comment section or in my PMs. Thanks. Advance Happy New Year guysü§ü",Need 4 people from INDIA for Spotify Premium Family

I'm a bit stingy, so I wanted to make sure this was really something I wanted to sign up for. While I was on the other account, my other account apparently listened to a metric f-ton of Dominican pop music. Idk if someone accessed the account, or I left something running, but i listened to so much of it.

I really like those sites that analyze your playlists/account to help you understand your music taste better. I was using a few of these and saw that a ton of pop music was on my most-listened. I was using the [pudding.cool](https://pudding.cool) AI account roaster today and there was more Dominican pop music than music I actually listen to. Nothing against it, I just prefer other types of music.

spotify,"Hi, I want to apologize in advance if this is common knowledge or answered before. I did search Google/Bing and YouTube several times and browsed a few keywords in this sub as well with no luck. 

Problem: Every night when I plug in my Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra it strangley triggers Spotify to begin playing relaxing music from a sleep Playlist that I never created nor listened to. I rarely use Spotify since creating an account years ago and I only recently installed it again on this new phone exclusively to listen to Joe Rogans podcasts. I dont ever use Spotify to listen to actual music when driving or other situations because I prefer Pandora instead. 

I have spent more time than I like to admit looking through the app settings and even logging in via web browser to find an option where I could stop the music from triggering automatically whenever I plug in my phone before bed. Even weirder is, I deleted all my Playlist and even disliked the sleep songs in an attempted to stop it and even force stopped Spotify before charging yet it still automatically plays sleep music every night when charging. 

My only remaining option I can think of is to sign out or delete my Spotify profile and create a new one to see if it continues to happen.

spotify,[removed],That Blowin' Powder At In Studio 54 Disco Shit
spotify,"Recently moved to Spotify after being forced to use YouTube music which is horrendous in every way imaginable. One of the things that Google play music used to do was if you were listening to a song and you liked that song and wanted to hear more songs similar, you could simply select *start radio* while the song was playing and the song would not be interrupted and Google play music would append a playlist based on the song you're currently listening to and not interrupt anything. This was fantastic for parties and gatherings and worked well as moods change fluently during the party. With Spotify, if I hear a song that I like and want to hear more and go to the radio station based on that song I have to wait for the song to end before I can click play because it will start the song over again. Have you ever had a bunch of chicks listening to semi-charmed life only to have it restart a minute in? It pisses them off. It also decreases my chances of getting laid that evening. Spotify please fix this crap so I can get laid more often. 

Also while you're at it it would be great if I could just scroll up on the currently playing list to see what I previously played. Why in God's name do I have to go through four menus to find the recently played playlist on my Android device? It's like once that song is finished playing I'll never know what it was if I wasn't paying attention to the phone at the time. It's really nice to be able to go back and see what I've played because a lot of times I'll hear a song and I like to wear it out maybe I'll go back and listen to it three or four times. Sure I could add it to my ‚ù§Ô∏è songs but that's stupid if I know I just listened to it 10 minutes ago.  Yes, chicks like to listen to Semi-Charmed Life over and over again. 


I really miss Google play music. It was truly the golden-age app of music streaming. I consider it the worst loss of 2020.

But if he tries to listen to music, my spotify keeps switching to whatever he is listening to every 30 seconds or so. So if I want to listen to music while he is on spotify as well, my spotify keeps switching to whatever he is listening to.

So I'm a GPM refugee, and in GPM (and YTM), every song in your library is kept in a Songs page, with the ability to browse through it and also shuffle the entire library of songs. I can't find anything like this in Spotify? I see an Artists page and Albums page but no Songs page in my library. If looks like I have to manually add every single one of my albums into a playlist to accomplish this, which is extremely tedious when I'm adding several hundred albums, and I'm also worried about bumping up on the 10k song limit per playlist.

Is there really no way just to easily shuffle your entire library or am I missing something? This seems like it should be a basic feature.",Shuffling entire library

But I noticed something, they would constantly play songs from artists with only one song. It was constant repeat of fake songs that had absolutely no sound. They‚Äôre fishing for our accounts and then using us to stream their fake music so that they can get freaking paid for the streams. I‚Äôm fuming that someone interrupted something as important to me as music, but god damn these scammers are getting creative. Every artist had their own art and their own unique name but the songs were just silence for the most part.

So users, please watch out for this, and I hope we can get this popular enough so that Spotify does something about it.","My account got hacked, then I noticed something"

spotify,"I listen to a lot of spotify, and a lot of indie rock, so one of spotify's album categories on my home page is Best Indie Rock Albums of the 90s. To their credit, I've loved the albums they've recommended, like Cherry Peel, Emergency and I, and Brighten the Corners, but the problem is that they KEEP recommending albums that I've not only listened to, but actively downloaded and keep in my weekly listening diet. Obviously spotify keeps a comprehensive list of what music im playing, so why does it feel the need to suggest The Mollusk by Ween in the 90s indie rock category when its already in my Jump Back In?

Some added personalization would be much appreciated, maybe a feature like Youtube that marks an album as ""I've already heard this"" or ""Stop recommending me this"". Or just at least stop showing me albums that are literally in my downloads.",Spotify's album recommendations are VERY flawed and user-unfriendly

spotify,"I've been using Spotify since 2013 (eversince it was available in my country) and I'm really enjoying it. Best 10 bucks I'm spending monthly. But after I bought my first iphone ever, i now see why so many folks are leaving spotify for apple music. 

Its not cause Apple Music has a better song library. Its just like it seems that Spotify is just too lazy when it comes to support for some things compared to apple music. I'll give you a few examples: 

1) I'm driving a BMW F30 with Idrive...it does work with spotify but i can control the music only with the idrive knob. However ever since I've been testing Apple Music (free 5 month trial) i can finally change AND select songs with my steeringwheel buttons, which is not possible on spotify. Further more i can go INSIDE the playlist and select a song i want to play. another thing thats not possible with spotify. Oh and the album cover is showing in the display as well with apple music. And im not even talking about the poor support with android phones 

2) Apple Shortcut/Siri integration: Works well with apple music. Spotify? not so much. The only thing you can do with shortcuts/siri is to open the damn app. Wanna set an automation when you come home to start a playing spotify or a certain playlist? Bad luck. Wanna tell siri to play something from spotify? Bad luck. 

3) Apple Watch: Apple music lets you save your songs for offline use on your watch so that when you're going out for a run, you dont need to bring a phone. Spotify? Nah, not possible. You can stream songs to the watch if you have the more expensive model but that was implemented like what....half a year ago? 

Spotify frustrates me more and more with such little things.

Instead of campaigning how unfair the 30% apple cut is, they should focus on supporting their Application to gain more paying customers!

Right now, 3 of her top five songs are from this album, which dropped about a day ago, and Blank Space, which has TWO POINT SIX BILLION views on Youtube right now, is NOT present. 

Do artists get to just choose what their ""most popular"" songs are now? Because no way in hell is ""gold rush"", with 14 million streams, more ""Popular"" than Blank Space.

If Spotify has changed this model, they need to also change the title of the section to ""Featured"" instead of ""Popular"", because it is a flat out lie.

I can fix this by opening my downloaded playlists while connected to the internet, but it's annoying to have to do, and I don't have a data plan so I can't do it while out and about.

spotify,"This is so frustrating.

Firstly, there's no offline storage so I cant take my (GPS) watch for a run and listen to my playlists without my phone (I've had to sign up to Apple Music, which is three months free at the moment, or transfer albums I already own and imported into iTunes).  Which is half the reason I wanted a smart watch.

Secondly, I have 'audio' devices all over running Spotify (PC, MacBook, Alexa).  So I figured my (expensive as fuck) watch would be able to remote control each device from my wrist, just like my phone can.

Except no.  Your watch only controls your phone.  Which then controls your Spotify on any device.

It works, but it's far from ideal because if, for any reason, your phone isnt on then you're screwed.  What's the point in having a remote control device if you're spending half your time ensuring your phone is alive and connected OK?!  Plus added battery drain on the phone.  

Not to mention that when you're out and about, with only your watch and phone, you have to be mindful of where your headphones are paired to (yesterday I ended up walking along with music coming from my backpack) because my Beats were paired to my watch, but Spotify (on the Watch) would only play music on the handset)

And how bad is the idea to create a new account and transfer music manually? That deletes all the followers, listening history, and you're left to retrain the algorithm on your listening habits. And most importantly, I paid for the entire year. I am not getting a refund on that, am I?

¬†

I tried clean reinstall and every possible hacks that would let me keep the original account at the end of the process. It looks like the only thing that works is shifting to a new account.¬†

Please stop providing impractical workarounds without keeping the original account. I keep using Spotify because it helps with discovering new music as I have been using it for a year and it knows me. I , may as well, shift to a different service if I am forced to create a new account anyway.¬†

To start off with, I found it was weird that songs like Fade to black, ride the lightning and for whom the Bell tolls (by Metallica, from the album ride the lightning) had the image cover of Master of Puppets. Now when I clicked fade to black, (or any RTL song) it came up with RTL album cover, but when I clicked the song title, it took me to a compilation album called 'The Metallica Collection' from 2009, by Metallica. Weird.

Then, I noticed that some other songs' albums covers were noticeably darker than usual, etc Number of the beast, Phantom of the opera (iron maiden) So I clicked the song, and the album cover was the usual one that appears on Spotify. But when I clicked the song title, it took me to an album that looked exactly like the album that was in the playlist. No remaster, darker colours, and a bonus track that was unplayable. This was the iron maiden album iron maiden, but it happens with number of the beast, Powerslave, mellon collie and the infinite sadness; and the list goes on.
Even more weird, when I tried to search any of these albums up on Spotify, none of them would come up; only the remastered ones or the available ones. It seems that these albums/songs are only accessible via this particular playlist? Any ideas?

spotify,"The grass isn't entirely greener on this side of the fence.

One thing I'm trying to figure out is cross-device play.  I do like that I can move between a few devices and continue playing where I left off.  That was a feature I was yearning for on GooglePlayMusic and YTM.  Now that I have it, it's a mixed blessing.

So how do I do this:   There's a couple of devices that, when I'm playing music on them, I'm 'working' and want it to start on a specific playlist.  The rest of my devices (truck, garage, phone), I want a different playlist.

The problem:
If I finish working in the garage and come in for the night, then sit down in front of my work-computer the next morning and hit 'play', it continues playing 'garage' music instead of 'work' music.  Then I hit play on my 'work' playlist but it starts over, not where it left off the previous morning.

spotify,"This one's just a weird thing I found on Spotify.

So I was on my homepage and saw the album ""Journey to the West"" as in the 2008 musical by Gorillaz's Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett. I noticed that it was credited under the artist 'Monkey' and out of curiosity, I opened the artist page.

Basically, this artist is supposedly responsible for a wide range of random singles and a few albums spanning totally distinct genres and sounds and is still active to this day. However, the about tab only describes the musical. It's not impossible that this is where Damon Albarn throws his experimental collaborations or something, but the weird thing is the silence and disconnect between any information online.

I suspect Spotify is probably just merging any artist with the name 'Monkey' onto the same page accidentally, but I thought I'd get a few fresh eyes.

Seriously.

What in the actual fuck?

VPN's are good for security and a lot of us paranoid tech users use them.

Most importantly: EVERY OTHER MAJOR FUCKING TECH COMPANY ON THE PLANET ALLOW VPN'S.

So, get with the fucking times and acclimate with the rest of society and allow me to use a VPN on a fucking **PAID** account.

Other wise I will absolutely not sign up after the trial even if I love your music - Instead, I'll go sign up for Google Music.","I am in the middle of a free 3 month premium trial and I'm falling in love with Spotify - but, I don't think I will sign up for a paid account UNTIL Spotify unblocks VPN's.

spotify,"I think a lot of people can agree with me that our music experience has drastically deteriorated since Spotify introduced us the new UI we basically never asked for. 

I'm not against changes or anything, it's just there are so much ideas coming from the community, but nothing is ever picked up by them. They just do their own thing and make the user experience worse and worse instead of improving it with the community ideas.

There are even like tons of SIMPLE things that are ultimately frustrating and that are still not implemented in Spotify, things like detectinng duplicates, actually show all songs from an artist in your library ( because they don't), searching for specific song meanwhile staying without breaking the shuffle mode, ....    All pretty minor things, but that would make a ocean of change for us users.

I feel like we are treated as shit by Spotify, they just do their own thing all time without taking any considerations of what their users actually want. Updating Spotify feels depressing at this point, updating should be all about improving, right??  The only goal the updates achieve now is pushing people over the edge to Apple Music.",Does Spotify even listent to it's community at this point?

spotify,"My dad works in a factory where they are allowed to listen to music over radio/speakers, but are not allowed to have phones or anything resembling a phone, so I'm looking for a dedicated music player that can be paired with his bluetooth speakers, and synced from a streaming app. 

I lean more towards Mighty Vibe because it has much greater storage capacity and supports amazon music, which I already have, whereas on the smart watches I'd have to buy a premium spotify account, but in the end, price is not a factor.

One thing that IS a major factor though, is the ability to be used while connected to a charger, since both the Vibe and the smart watches all seem to have a short battery life, 5 hours or less. If one of them is able to be played while charging, that is the clear winner, and if neither are, then it really comes down to which one charges the quickest so it can be reused again asap, since my dad's shifts are 12 hours long.

I would really love some advice here if you guys are familiar with these products, because I have never used mp3 players or smart watches and really know nothing about them!

spotify,"Hi,

I listen to Spotify on my Google Pixel 2 (android 11) with my Sony XM4 bluetooth headphones.


Today I have been experiencing an issue where Spotify will automatically increase my phone's volume to max. If I turn the volume down while a song is playing, a second later it will jump back up to max.

This issue only happens on Spotify. I have used my headphones/phone while using Netflix and Youtube, and they don't have the same problem, it's only Spotify.

I turned off the touch controls on the headphone settings in case that was the issue, but the issue persisted.

I turned off the ""normalize volume"" setting in the Spotify settings, but that didn't work either.

Anyone know why this is happening?",Spotify automatically putting phone's volume setting to max

I am a student, so I can get the 1 month free and ¬£4.99 payment. But I see on the sign up page that the individual plan gives you 3 months free. 

Can I just sign up as an individual for 3 months and if I want to carry on using the service switch to the cheaper student offer? I know there's verification and stuff, that's fine. But I don't want to accidentally lock myself in to paying the higher amount.

Cheers!",¬£4.99 student membership w/ 1 month free or ¬£9.99 individual membership for 3 months free.. Can I choose individual and then just switch after 3 months?

spotify,"This has been going on for a few months.¬† Whenever I'm listening to the android app of Spotify, there have been many moments where the sound will just suddenly cut out.¬† It's not muted, volume hasn't changed at all, and yet the timer keeps going.¬† This cut out lasts anywhere between 5 to 15 seconds and then the audio comes back, but it doesn't come back to the point where it cut out, all those muted seconds get missed.¬† So I find myself hitting the back button to go back a few seconds to try and catch those missed moments again, but most of the time, the audio cuts out again and it takes about 5 or more go backs before the audio finally decides to cooperate.¬† Again, this issue began when I first started listening to podcasts a few months ago, but it's present during normal songs as well on the app.¬† I currently am using Google Podcasts to listen to my shows, but I would like to keep using Spotify.

spotify,"So I‚Äôm wondering if people have experiences with Spotify adding (and possibly removing) songs that you‚Äôve liked? 

I set my liked songs to shuffle and repeat that playlist. I left my computer, took a shower, and came back and Intro - by The XX had just started playing. Halfway through the song I realized there was a faint voice rapping on it. I listened to this song (and album) a ton in high school and never remembered there really being many lyrics on it. Then I checked the album cover and it wasn‚Äôt the same as the actual album. 

After further inspection, I realized this song was off of a playlist, I think, of a guy who just put vocals over mostly instrumental songs. Never seen or heard of him in my life. Never added that version of the song to my liked songs. I went to check The XX page and apparently Spotify removed all the songs by them that I had added. I added these back around 2015 and don‚Äôt really want to add them because I like the songs and order I have them added currently, but want these older songs to still pop up randomly, which is annoying. 

Anyways, I decided to close Spotify and reopen thinking it maybe glitched or something. I click back on the playlist, set it to shuffle and repeat, and jam out. The very next song is the same one that I removed. It shows that it isn‚Äôt liked and I know for a fact I didn‚Äôt queue it up. 

Idk if this has happened with any other songs I have or if this happens to anybody else, but it‚Äôs pretty strange and annoying. I have no idea why this would happen. I am 100% certain nobody queued/liked it when I walked away or ever really. It also makes no sense for Spotify to play it when it‚Äôs not in the playlist I am listening to.",Random songs being added to liked songs?

I found this through [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/riffbase) and credits for developing it goes to [Iury Dias.](https://twitter.com/iurycdias)  


Explaining the tool in his own words  


&gt;As a musician and music-lover, I always found myself listening to specific parts of songs that I really enjoy instead of listening to whole songs. Maybe I like patterns too much, as I mainly listen to progressive rock/metal and math-rock, or maybe I want to learn how to play a certain part of a song, or maybe I just want to listen to that particular, awesome, unforgettable riff over and over again because it's just that good ü§©    
  
&gt;  
&gt;I didn't manage to find a tool that enabled me to save riffs from songs to be able to have a collection of them so I can listen to any of them whenever I want, so I decided to build one, and this is how Riffbase was born ‚ú®    
  
&gt;  
&gt;This is only the beginning. I have many features lined up to be built over the next months, but I wanted to share the first version already with the community so I can iterate faster on feedback, which is always welcome by the way üôè  Thanks a lot and happy riffing!",Absolutely loving this gem called Riffbase that lets you save your favourite snippets or riffs from Spotify

I've noticed a change in spotify's 'Song radio' functionality. In the past I would use that all the time to find new music and listen to new stuff.

spotify,"Okay so I‚Äôm trying out the 3 month free trial with Spotify to see if I like it over Apple Music. I‚Äôve been with Apple Music since it launched and I‚Äôve never had Spotify.

So as of right now I‚Äôm not a fan of the UI and how they organize my music. On Apple Music I click Artists and it brings me to a list of Artists that I‚Äôve only downloaded songs to my phone of. Then I click on that artist and it shows only the music I‚Äôve downloaded from the artist. 

As far as I‚Äôm aware that‚Äôs not possible with Spotify. The Artist section in library takes you directly to that artists personal music page where you see everything from singles to albums. Apple Music has artist pages but you have to search for them in the search engine. 

I‚Äôm not a fan of the way Spotify handles this. The way I search or music is by going to MY personal library and then going to the Artist and seeing the stuff I‚Äôve downloaded. I‚Äôm not a fan of being forced to see the artists page and then have to go and find what I‚Äôm looking for through there whole discography. You can scroll over to the albums tab and filter downloaded music only, but that only displays albums alphabetically and doesn‚Äôt break it up into artists so if you have a lot of albums, it‚Äôs a lot of scrolling and requires more work.

In other words unless I‚Äôm missing a feature, Apple kills Spotify in UI and over all ease of finding MY music. So Spotify peeps, tell me if I‚Äôm missing something here. Am I not finding a feature or is this just how Spotify is?",Apple Music user trying Spotify. Maybe I‚Äôm missing something but finding my downloaded music is way more annoying than AM

spotify,"I was very excited to check my stats for this year's Spotify wrapped. I was quite annoyed to know I couldn't get the report on my laptop but that was the least of my worries after a few minutes. As I started to swipe through the wrap on my phone I noticed how much the information displayed seemed off. Many of the artists and songs shown as my ""favorites"" were just songs/artists I had listened to a couple of times and couldn't associate with what so ever and I knew I had not listened to nearly as much as others. Additionally, I saw my minutes listened was at a mere ten thousand which was a mere third of what my brother had listened to and we listen practically the same amount. After a little investigation on [statsforspotify.com](https://statsforspotify.com) I found that it said my stats were way further off what Spotify had told me. It said my most listened to artists and songs were just what I thought they would be. The reason I trust this site is that under the recently played tab it shows the exact 50 most recent songs I've listened to and I can confirm they are right. This leads me to believe that statsforspotify has much more accurate stats and knowledge of my Spotify account. I could be completely wrong I just want to know if anyone else feels the same.

They are quick to attack Apple for crying out for being anti competitive but then turn around and drag their feet to improve their product on Apple devices. 

-Apple Watch app took years to come out and doesn‚Äôt cache songs for offline listening for workouts and honestly barely functions in my experience. 

-No support for Airplay 2 after over a year and a half. Ridiculous for an iOS app at this point. 

-No HomePod support, not even announced. This is huge as with HomePod mini I might pick up a few and get Apple Music and never look back to Spotify. This is their own fault, Apple has opened the API to third parties Pandora works and Amazon announced they‚Äôre working on an integration. For Amazon, HomePod is their direct competitor to their smart speakers!!

-No MFA. It‚Äôs 2020, that‚Äôs embarrassing. Any online account should have some basic form of MFA. Most services are moving away from SMS because it‚Äôs not secure enough. Spotify out here like it‚Äôs still 2009 and MFA isn‚Äôt a thing. 

-No word yet for a macOS app compiled for Apple silicon.

spotify,"As in the title, what is the process of it? Do you have to listen to a song for at least a minute for it to count 1 up, or it counts every second of you listening? 

I'm curious because every few days I'm discovering new music by listening to songs for around 15 seconds and adding it to playlist if I like the rythm and so on, I do it multiple times so I'm spending around 2 hours doing it and I wonder if it counts to the 2020 wrapped or it's not because I wasn't listening to song for minimum value of time for it to count. Since I did it more than 50 times this year and it takes around 2 hours, if it doesn't count, I lost more than 6000 minutes of listening time on my wrapped.

spotify,"Hi everybody.
I‚Äôm a long time iTunes user. This means that not only I have more than 2500 saved songs in my library, but I also have more than 900 mp3s (songs that are not available on any music catalogue) that I carefully downloaded and compiled with the correct metadata over the course of more than 13 years.

As you might‚Äôve guessed by now, I‚Äôm pretty attached to my music library. Making the switch to Apple Music a couple of years ago was a big sacrifice for me, but I knew that streaming services were here to stay and storing songs in a library was soon going to become obsolete.

So for the last 3 years I tried to keep my music library going (Apple Music allows me to upload mp3s to the cloud), while trying to embrace the whole streaming service experience.
Lately though, I started to realize how much more optimized the Spotify user experience is: suggestion algorhytms are arguably better, curated playlist are updated more frequently and in general the social features such as Wrapped 2020 are much more compelling.

With that said, is there anybody who, like me, left its own music library behind to pursue a more modern listening experience? If yes, do you miss your old music library or perhaps suggest I do the same?

Thanks!",Dealing with old mp3s
spotify,"I‚Äôm probably the minority here but I‚Äôve never used Spotify for the playlist feature, I just saved the song to my library and built up thousands of songs in the one place.

Now no disrespect to this artist if in fact they are a real artist, but I don't think it is.

* Do I need to add all 5 sub-accounts upon the time of activating for the master account or can I take as long as I want and just add them whenever I want?
* My boyfriend lives with me and I want to add him to the Family plan, but he's already subscribed to a 1-year Individual Premium plan. Does he need to cancel his subscription before I can add him? Can I add him without breaking his own plan? What happens to his plan? Does he get refunded for his remaining months (he subscribed October 2020)?
* We're using my boyfriend's billing information for this new plan which I'm sure isn't an issue with Spotify. Or am I wrong?
* In the future, am I able to remove members that I added as sub-accounts and replace them with other accounts? Are there special rules for this?

like others mentioned before, most of the songs in my Spotify playlist are just a song that I cycled for like a whole day and never listen to it ever again. and one of the songs is just like that but somehow it got to the top 20. and another song that I have been listening to for the whole year just got rank 76.   
I've also heard people say that Spotify only start to collect data after Oct.31. I think that is true and extremely irresponsible. my top 1 song of the year is a song that I only cycled from Nov.1st to Nov.10th. never heard of it until November. So I think the theory is definitely true. 

with that being said. I hope Spotify can actually change how they collect date. I want to see a wrapped playlist about the whole year not the whole November.",Spotify wrapped is very inaccurate

\------- My letter overal opinion ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Spotify devs, quick overview on podcast video experience, hope you can fix it. 

(Using Spotify desktop App)

\-No comments: people want to comment, interact, feel important. You are loosing billions of lines of text that will be indexed by search engines, cross links which pump up Page rank, user interactions browser cookies. You are loosing market share.

\-No captions: ""Deaf people? If they can't read lips, they better learn. Not our problem! ""

   ""Want to have the text transcription for journalists, students, amateurs, random text use? not our problem!"" 

   ""Are you a robot, or google scraper, and want to index the text in the podcast speach, to pump up  our views? We don't like more views or be indexed. We LOVE to lose market shares""

 You are loosing market shares.

\- No translation captions: in the AI era, where translated captions ARE TRIVIAL, you cut out that half of the world population which don't speak english, and would like to watch the podcast translated. You are loosing market share. Deaf foreign people, well, really not our problem I know.

\-Missing video speed adjustment: many, many people, listen podcast at 1.25+ speed, they are already commenting it on Youtube: ""We can't do it on spotify!"" ...Spotify: ""Not my problem!"" ...go watch the comments, devs.

\-""Want to stop watching the podcast, and start back from that second, WITHOUT SEARCHIN IT, LIKE EVERY OTHER MAJOR VIDEO PLATFORM IN THE WORLD!? Dude, who do you think we are, magicians!? get out you and your sorcery tricks!""

\-""Want to setup your video quality, because maybe you have poor bandwidth, or go pawa cos you have a 300inch monitor 8K? WE THOUGHT WE WHERE CLEAR THAT THESE ARE NOT OUR PROBLEMS, GET A BETTER PC/CONNECTION, or watch it like poor people on a normal screen, you both loosers.""

\-""Want to have the picture in picture floating video box option, like every other major browser on the market? Who do you think we are, freakin Firefox, dude!?!?""

\-BUFFERING: ""want to use a browser or do some other activity wich require network, like THE MAJORITY OF USERS, whom use the podcast like a side TV show entertaiment doing work? NOT OUR PROBLEM."" Podcast video is constantly buffering, ALSO WITHOUT OTHER BROWSERS, all my firefox tabs goes super laggy, forget to do something else on a browser without super lag and freezing browser/spotify. ""WE OWN the network, give us ALL your bandwith, not our problem if you need it for emails. If u want email, wait for buffering video. Can't pretend to have both, dude.""

\-Devs: ""Please, also don't move or resize the window if you want a smooth video, we managed to make it freeze, glitch and stop playing, everything you do to the window, you are welcome!"".

\-Giant shadow making super dark top and bottom of the screen (basically half of video window), any time the mouse goes over, for seconds. ARE YOU SERIOUS? wtf. 

\-Devs: ""We also managed to use 3 times the RAM amount of every other browser, to give you the worst user experience of every video platform, requiring subscription while the others don't: YOU ARE WELCOME!"". 

Over all, nice job devs: videobox, play, pause. Subscrbe to watch. What they would want more? Well done.

spotify,"Hello earth people, I‚Äôve been thinking, and I have no idea if anyone has ever thought of this, but what if Spotify did a playlist exchange. The playlist exchange would connect every username that has a public playlist and shares it in a database. In order to establish privacy, the person has the ability to set a playlist exchange username, so in the case that their playlist is shared, it can‚Äôt really be linked back to anyone. If you have contacts, you have the ability to add them as a friend with a choice of using your real username. Now onto how it could work, like stated before, Spotify will exchange usernames by location set and usernames with public playlists. Then Spotify will send each username with another person, it could be a friend, a DJ from M√©xico, a doctor from Seattle, or even someone from another place in the world. But, you will not be able to retrieve personal details about this person apart from their username, playlist name, and duration of playlist. I think it would be pretty cool if preferences were added like certain genres, artists, and languages could be filtered in or out depending on a users taste. Tags could also be added to specify the details of the playlist. For example : Languages: English, Spanish, Korean Genre: R&amp;B, Reggaet√≥n, K-Pop could be possible tags. There could also be a feature where you can see how many viewed your playlist, where they are from, and their positive reactions (via liking a song or adding it to their playlist). I think it would be amazing to listen to someone‚Äôs playlist from a different part of the world or even a different part of the country. Spotify let me know üòÇ

I'm at my wits end trying to expand my exposure to muisc, but I don't know how to find what I'm looking for and the more I listen to my auto-recommended playlists the more narrow these seem to become which is exactly opposite of what I'm trying to do.

\- Depeche mode is handsdown my favourite band esp songs like In Your Room, Stripped, Policy of Truth.  
\- Blaqk audio is okaayyy i guess but a little too cheesy I can't take it seriously  
\- Chvrches. love them but sometimes gets too girly that it bumps me out of my zone  
\- Goldfrapp and Dave Gahn (of depeche mode) do a song called ocean that I'm LOVING  
\- Halsey strange love is a current fave though will never match DM's strange love haha (not that it's trying to these are very different songs)  
\- I took a pill in Ibiza, Wake me up, Mi Gente, Arty Remix Halsey Hurricane all get me going  
\- but HATE so much other top 40: Beibers too whiny, Pitbull's too worldwide, katy perry too boppy etc  
\- however I somehow really love wolves/bad liar/good for you selena gomez and some cardi b  
\- I'm always looking for nightclub/party playlists but they all sound too... dance trance and dreamy  
\- AM by Arctic monkeys is one of my favourite albums EVER  
\- Love Twilight sad (scottish band nothing to do with twilight the book)  
\- Bat for lashes, and Die Antword also good.

spotify,"I noticed recently that I haven't been seeing many albums.

* Go to search
* Click on category like ""rock""
* This takes me to a page that has rock playlists, rock albums I might be interested in, new rock albums, and rock albums by subcategory (like classic rock with various classic rock albums and playlists).

New navigation
* Go to search
* Click on a category like ""rock""

During whitch my musical taste has been changing quite a lot from 90's hip hop to dubsteb , but for about 7-8 years Ive been getting more and more into rock and then into metal and some funk /jazz soul and classical.

The problem arrises that I used to like absolutely every album of any musician that I just slightly liked , so my liked playlist is absolute crap with well over 1000 songs, that most of them I cant even stand. But the daily mix seems to be based on the liked songs rather than what you tend to be listening in the past months, is there a way to switch that , because out of the 6 daily mix playlists 3 tend to be of music I havent liked in +-7 years.

TL:DR:  some of the daily mix playlists seem to be based on the liked songs rather than most listened to, long time user so that liked playlist is crap and too long to delete one by one by a two button process. Is there a way to make daily mix be based only on listened songs?",Daily mix isue

spotify,"I'm new to spotify. I know I might be the last person on earth to try streaming music. And generally my experience over the last month is that I loathe it, but see no other way to passively discover new music in 2020.

I'm one of these old school people that began building my digital music library in the 90s. I used winamp for a long while and switched to media monkey around 2005. Over 20+ years I have collected lots of music but more importantly LOTS of data about my music library. Playcounts, skips, playlists, ratings, custom scripts and algorithms that create ratings and other systems to rank music.

When I switch to spotify it's like giving up a tried and true customized dream vehicle for a Fischer price steering wheel toy. Spotify lacks so much, there's no ratings, no easily accessible data like play counts. Not even a simple EQ. Have I really become ""old man yells at cloud"" here? Help me!!

**MM to spotify&gt;** I found a round about method to import a top 500 playlist into spotify through 3rd party services so spotify would at least get some indication of my preferences. It was about 70% accurate at song recognition. I went through and liked everything in there, followed lots of artists. It allowed spotify to generate some playlists to my tastes, but they mostly contain the music I just injected via playlist and not much new.

**Spotify to MM&gt;** The dream would be to have some kind of integration, where playcounts on spotify could be linked or exported to include in my Media Monkey database. Or alternatively, how wonderful would that be to have an API to stream music directly from within Media Monkey so it can keep track of plays ratings etc, and use virtual links to spotify in lieu of mp3 files.

Some people have suggested use of last.fm scrobbling. Media Monkey has some integration with last.fm too. it's a thought to explore.

tl;dr I'm old and set in my ways with using media monkey and won't be throwing away a near lifetime of data and tools to convert to being a spotify user. Who out there is a dinosaur like myself? What do you do to find new music?",any Media Monkey and Spotify users out there?

spotify,"Spotify is forcing a subset of their users to Beta their new Desktop UI as phase 2 of testing it. Phase 1 was testing it with their 'Rockstar' users (I do not know if Rockstar users opt-in to that or what). Phase 0 was internal.

&amp;#x200B;

I woke up to the Beta Desktop UI a few days ago. I am livid.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Why this forced Beta is wrong in a shortlist\*\*\*

\*\*1) It's disrespectful to paying customers to turn them into your lab rats.\*\*

Exaggerated example - Imagine if the Government came up and grabbed you, a taxpaying citizen, and said 'You will be testing our new Covid vaccine. You have no choice. We do not care."" and pricked you in the arm. There would be rioting in the streets. Let's interpolate that back to this less severe situation and realize what Spotify is doing is wrong. It might not be murder or torture or forced medical practices, but it is wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*2) Participants aren't helpful because they didn't want to be participants.\*\*

 There is a clear difference from the very very few folks who are OK with unwillingly being part of the Beta. Those folks have tended to dislike the changes, but offer proper feedback without the rage and disgust of being forced into the group. This feedback is infinitely more useful than the angry folks going 'I didn't want this and it sucks'.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*3) There is no way to opt-out.\*\* 

Hell, there was no way to opt-in. I would be maybe cool with it if they forced the beta but gave me a way to switch out and they told me why they put me in the group. Like 'Hey, you have used our software for 10 years on Xbox, Desktop, and mobile and we value your opinion the most. Please test this out, but you may opt-out at any time'. The disrespect of forcing it would be negated by my Ego saying 'Cool, they value my opinion as a longtime subscriber'. And I do understand that at some point it is very valuable to get the opinion of folks who didn't want to test the new design. But you must let them get out of it if they do not want to.

But, I know nothing besides the fact I have paid them for almost a decade and they never asked me to help them like this and I cannot opt-out and they have not told me why I am a part of this group.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*4) Functionality is cut or broken all over the place\*\*

The update is bad. It broke so much and offered basically no new neat features. It's a mobilification of what should be a Desktop experience. I think there is literally nothing new. It's just different and worse. One person was dragging a folder they have and a bug caused the folder to absorb everything it dragged over. Yup, all their lists are totally messed up and they ever asked for that. Time to spend who knows how long fixing that up. If I did that, I have enough playlists it would take me some time to fix it. Want to sort by Artist? There is no column for artists anymore. It is gone. You have to triple-click the Title column.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*5) The Spotify team has not updated us in over a week\*\*

They updated us once on the 19th to say ""We are gonna fix like 3 of the bugs"". That is all. There are now over 40 pages of feedback(almost exclusively negative).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*TLDR - Spotify is forcing users to Beta their stuff and beyond that horribleness is the fact the update is terrible and you cannot opt-out and they have not responded with a proper update in over a week.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Please can you all give your two cents about what they are doing in their forum for feedback?

[https://community.spotify.com/t5/Desktop-Windows/New-Desktop-Experience-your-feedback-wanted/td-p/5072418](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Desktop-Windows/New-Desktop-Experience-your-feedback-wanted/td-p/5072418)

It is filled with negative feedback and the Spotify team is hiding. We need the Spotify community's help to stand up and say ""1) This is wrong. 2) We do not approve of this. 3) Continued behavior like this will result in us leaving the service"".

&amp;#x200B;

spotify,"I have no idea when this update happened, I'm assuming in the past week or so. my spotify desktop app updated to this new version (1.1.46.916.g416cacf1-a ) and it changed how my playlist was sorted.

It was originally listed as #| Title | Album | Date | \*clock icon\* 

i like sorting my playlist by artist, it's much easier for me. I was coming on here originally to ask if anyone knew how to fix this, but i figured it out and want to pass my knowledge to anyone who may not know of this. If you wish to sort your playlist by artist, you will have to click on the Title section of the toolbar three or four times, depending on preference if you want the artist names to be alphabetized from A-Z or Z-A.

Hope this helps anyone!",Desktop App Update; Sorting playlist issue Solved
spotify,"Another month, another Spotify update that removes functionality. On the PC desktop app specifically, I once could click an artists name in my Artist's Collection page, and it would show me all the thumbed tracks from that artist. I used this all the time, and now these links just take you to the artist's page. I can't fine a way to view all thumbed tracks from a single artist, other than searching through my Liked Songs playlist, which also doesn't work. If I search for Roots Manuva, no results come up, but when I search for Roots, all his stuff, as well as a few other songs called Roots, come [up.](https://up.So) Searching the whole name should definitely work. Also with searching, I searched Dirty, the title of a song and it found around 6 results in my playlist, but when I clicked Play on the track, it queued up all 6 results to play, rather than just start playing that playlist, from the song I selected as it used to. Also, it used to be when you used the navigation arrows at the top, your place on a given playlist would be saved, now it's not. Now if I'm looking through a playlist, and click someone's name, it takes me to their page as it should, but then it resets where i was scrolling when i use the back arrow. It didn't behave this way before. We also lost the ability to see our whole queue. Now it only shows the next 30 or so. I can't drag things up a list anymore. If you had songs queued and added another that you wanted to put NEXT in queue, you could add it to queue, then drag it to the top of the list. Now I can't drag things. I can move them up like 10 spaces, as many as fit on the screen at once, but I cannot drag them and hold at the top to make the list scroll.

Now, instead of this imagine there's a feature that allows you to play that particular song next, and takes you back into the loop for your curated playlist (and plays the next song in your playlist automatically without pressing too many buttons). 

This way you listen to that song one time without having to add in the playlist.

spotify,"I have the new update for desktop Spotify which is bad enough as is but now when listening to a song in a playlist if I choose to press the skip button it's just skipping through songs in a different playlist.

Example

I'm playing Song 3 (S3) in Playlist 1(P1). If I skip it should play S4 in P1 but it'll play S1 in P6. If I manually choose S4 in P1 then press skip again it will play S2 in P6. If is go back to P1 and skip it'll go to S3 in P6 essentially playing through all of P6 in order when I'm trying to listen to P1.

spotify,"I made the switch to Spotify until Apple redesigns Music from the ground up. Apple Music is probably the most buggy app I have ever used. 
I really want to keep using Apple Music. I have been with it since it‚Äôs release and I came from Beats Music.

&gt; Apple Music feels way too heavy. It‚Äôs hard to explain but you have to use it for some time and then switch to Spotify to understand what I mean. It‚Äôs slow when loading playlists, music, the app, a page, anything. It‚Äôs too damn slow.

&gt; I decided to go against the nature of Apple Music (focus on library, and less on playlists) by focusing primarily on playlists. I dumped the idea of building a library because I most likely remember most of the music I like, stopped using the iCloud music library upload, and put the music I dont listen to often in a playlist. Anyways, the iCloud music library has a knack of replacing songs that aren‚Äôt available on Apple Music anymore with another version of the song somewhere else. 
	You might think, ‚ÄúReally, you bitching about that?‚Äù Yes. Let‚Äôs say you have a Beatles album, Rubber Soul to be exact. Michelle isn‚Äôt available on the Rubber Soul album anymore because the studio removed it for some unknown reason. Apple, instead of graying the song out and telling you that its no longer available (which i prefer) instead finds it in some compilation called ‚ÄúSongs of the 60‚Äôs‚Äù adds it into your library, doesn‚Äôt include it in the Beatles artists page, and yeah it doesn‚Äôt even tell you its removed from rubber soul. No gray out, no notification, most of the time it doesn‚Äôt even appear in your recently added. Oh and if the song does come back to the album, it wont replace it. This is annoying when you have over 9,000 songs in your library. 
	Now I deleted my whole library and focused on playlists. The playlists aren‚Äôt any better. Changing playlist pictures on Spotify updates it on every single device you are signed in on right away. Apple sometimes never does it. I had to update a few playlist covers right. None of them changed on my iPhone, or iPad. Just on the Mac. When i went to the social network page where you can see your shared playlists, it still showed the old covers. When I tried to stop sharing the playlist, the done option was grayed out. I was so damn confused. It literally wouldn‚Äôt let me share or stop sharing playlists because of a playlist cover or something. I don‚Äôt know. Like i said, its buggy.

There are some other things i do not like about Apple like how it handles its radio tab, the algorithm for music, and the heavy focus on popular genres and lack of playlists on some other ones (blues). 

Spotify isn‚Äôt all perfect. No radio for example and honestly, sometimes i can do without the dark mode. Oh and when looking for albums, i dont want to see:

- Sgt. Peppers
- Sgt. Peppers (Remastered)
- Sgt. Peppers (Deluxe edition)
- Sgt. Peppers (super deluxe edition)

Just show me the latest release or something. Apple has it so it shows i believe the latest and then at the bottom they show different versions. It is less cluttered.",Made the switch from Apple Music. Why I did it.

If anyone on here is Christian and would like some really good indie style Christian music or some more undiscovered worship bands I‚Äôll link my playlists below!

spotify,"On my PC client, I cannot add songs to my 'liked' list, it maxes out to however many songs it has in it at that time. I have spotify premium on a family plan. It has something to do with my PC client. If I completely close spotify on my PC I can add songs fine on my mobile. If they are both open, and I add a song on my mobile, I see that it is on my liked list only on mobile,  and I cannot play it, it just fizzes out and nothing plays when I select that song. Perhaps this is caused by sync issues?","Cannot add songs on my PC client, even if it is just open."
